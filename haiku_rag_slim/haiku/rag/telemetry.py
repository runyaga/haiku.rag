# Scoped Logfire instance — every span emitted through `logfire.span(...)`
# on this object carries `instrumentation_scope.name = "haiku.rag"` instead
# of the default "logfire". The scope is OTel's identifier for *which
# library* produced the span, separate from `service.name` which is the
# running process. Downstream consumers (Logfire UI saved views, OTel
# collectors, alert rules) can then filter on `scope.name = haiku.rag`
# rather than catching every span the SDK ever exports.
#
# Cross-library instrumentations (pydantic-ai, FastAPI, OpenAI) keep their
# own scopes — this only retags the spans WE write.

      don't interleave with RichHandler logs. Pass None to let logfire
      decide (its own default applies).
    - scrubbing: None (default) keeps logfire's secret scrubbing on. Pass
      False to disable it when span content legitimately contains tokens
      that trip the scrubber (e.g. eval answer text).
    - include_content: whether pydantic-ai instrumentation may attach prompt
      and completion content to spans. Disabled by default because prompts,
      completions, and retrieved corpus text may contain sensitive data.
