# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Security

- **SQL injection: every LanceDB predicate is escaped.** Predicates were built
  by f-string interpolation in 46 places and 14 interpolated a value that never
  passed through `escape_sql_string`. `store/repositories/chunk.py:170` is
  inside `get_by_id`, reached while resolving a `rag_cite` chunk id the MODEL
  supplied, so the untrusted path was the citation path itself; another was a
  raw predicate on a `.delete()`. Two helpers, `eq_predicate` and
  `in_predicate`, make a raw interpolation unexpressible at those sites.
  ASD STIG V-222607.
- **`filter` is gone from the MCP surface.** `list_documents` and `analyze`
  each took an arbitrary SQL `WHERE` clause from a model straight into the
  store -- two passthroughs on two different predicates. Both are dropped from
  the MCP tools and retained on the library API, where the caller is code
  rather than a model. ASD STIG V-222607, V-222609.
- **Prompt and completion content stays off spans by default.**
  `configure(include_content=...)`, defaulting to off, so retrieved corpus text
  does not leave the host on a span merely because `LOGFIRE_TOKEN` is set.
  ASD STIG V-222444.

### Added

- **An audit subsystem.** `haiku.rag.audit` -- a record that cannot omit who
  did something, emit sites at the boundaries, a durable spool, and
  store-and-forward to a file or a syslog-over-TLS collector.
  - `audit/record.py`: a 14-field `AuditEvent` with closed vocabularies for
    event, component and outcome. `actor` and `actor_source` are validated
    against each other, so a record cannot claim an identity it did not
    establish, and cannot claim anonymity for a request it authenticated.
  - `audit/emit.py`: an `@audited` decorator, and `AuditWriteError` -- a write
    that cannot be recorded fails rather than proceeding unrecorded, per the
    configured `on_failure`.
  - `audit/spool.py`: a hash-chained append-only segment, fsynced per record,
    with a sealed footer. A truncated tail is detectable; a torn last line
    keeps the intact prefix rather than discarding the segment.
  - `audit/forward.py`: drains only sealed, quiet segments whose writer is
    gone, and deletes only what the sink accepted.
  - `audit/sinks.py`: `FileSink` and `SyslogTLSSink`, RFC 5424 framed with
    RFC 6587 octet counting. The SD-ID is required configuration -- PEN 32473
    is RFC 5612's documentation number and must not be shipped as a default.
  - `audit:` configuration section, `extra="forbid"`, refusing a configuration
    that is enabled with no sinks.
  - All 10 MCP tools are `@audited`; the 11 bare `except Exception` handlers
    that swallowed outcomes are gone.
  ASD STIG V-222431, V-222462, V-222463, V-222465, V-222471-V-222477,
  V-222487-V-222499.

### Fixed

- **A SIGTERM left no shutdown record.** `serve` emits `service.stop` from a
  `finally`, and the default SIGTERM handler terminates the interpreter without
  unwinding. `systemctl stop` sends SIGTERM, so the ordinary stop path produced
  no record while a crash produced one. ASD STIG V-222469.
- **A rejected credential was recorded as an open control plane.**
  `actor_source` was derived from `actor`, so a REFUSED request and a server
  with no token configured both recorded `auth_disabled` -- opposite facts
  about the server, conflated in the audit record. ASD STIG V-222462.

### Corrections to earlier assessment work

The issues carry the findings; this section carries what earlier passes of the
assessment got WRONG, because a reader deciding whether to trust the rest needs
to know how it failed.

- **"haiku.rag 4.0.3"** appeared as the assessed version. It is not a version
  of anything and appears nowhere in the package. It survived a full CAT I pass
  and a CAT II logging pass before anyone ran `importlib.metadata.version`. The
  target is 0.82.1.
- **"Eight raw predicates" was wrong in both directions.** Three of the sites
  listed were already escaped -- naming a safe line as a finding damages an
  assessment as much as missing an unsafe one -- and six were missed, including
  the `.delete()`. The count came from a grep for `.where(f"`, which cannot see
  a `.delete()` or a value built by a `join()` on the preceding line. The real
  figure is 14, enumerated by an AST walk that fails if a new site appears.
- **The second MCP SQL passthrough was missed.** The assessment named
  `list_documents` and not `analyze`, which forwards its own `filter` into
  `ChunkRepository.search`. A grep for the tool decorator would have found it;
  a grep for `list_documents` did not.
- **`include_content` was added as a parameter wired to nothing.** It defaulted
  safe and was never passed on, so the patch read correctly and did nothing.
  Caught by an independent review, twice more in the same package: a check
  testing for the presence of the string `"include_content="` rather than the
  value, and an AST walk reading one node type rather than what the code does.

## [0.82.1] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed

- Document timestamps include timezone information and satisfy the MCP
  date-time output schema. Stored timestamps without an offset are read as
  host-local time; a database written under a different host timezone shifts
  by that offset.

## [0.82.0] - 2026-09-03

### Removed

- `lancedb.uri`. Write `lancedb.databases: {NAME: <location>}`; a config carrying
  `uri` fails to load with that message. Configurations generated by
  `init-config` through 0.81 carry `uri: ""` and must drop the key.
- `HAIKU_RAG_DB`. Capabilities cover the databases the configuration places, or
  the `db_path` argument.
- `DB_PATH` in the `app/` backend and `examples/custom_agent_agui.py`. Both load
  the configuration as the CLI does (`HAIKU_RAG_CONFIG_PATH`, `./haiku.rag.yaml`,
  the platform directory); the compose files set
  `HAIKU_RAG_CONFIG_PATH=/app/haiku.rag.yaml` and mount `DB_VOLUME` at `/data`.

### Changed

- `qa.max_searches` counts search units: searches a model emits in one
  response share a unit, up to 3 per unit; sequential searches pay one unit
  each.
- Searches in one model response deduplicate their results: evidence a sibling
  search already showed collapses to a reference line, and a picture attaches
  once per response.
- Every database has a name: the key in `lancedb.databases`, or the path's stem
  for `--db PATH`, `db_path=` and the default database, which is the entry
  `haiku.rag` under `storage.data_dir` and selectable by that name.
  `SearchResult.source`, `Document.source` and `Citation.source` carry it on
  every value a database produces.
- `db_path=` beside a configured `lancedb.databases` raises
  `AmbiguousDatabaseError` (`HaikuRAG`, `create_capability`, `create_mcp_server`,
  `Sandbox`). `haiku-rag --db PATH` and `haiku-ingester --db PATH` open that path
  whatever is configured.
- `DatabaseRef(name, location, given)` replaces `DatabaseRef(name, uri, db_path)`;
  `DatabaseScope.at(path)` added; `locate_database` returns `Path | str`.
  `IngesterApp(config, scope)` takes a resolved scope in place of `db_path`.
  `SingleDatabaseSession(ref, config)` replaces `SingleDatabaseSession(db_path,
  config, source=)`. `Store.db_path` is `None` for a database behind a URI.
- Opening a configured or default database that does not exist raises
  `SourceUnavailableError` naming the database and the remedy (`haiku-rag init`
  or `create=True`), where the default database raised `FileNotFoundError` with
  its path. A database given as a path still raises `FileNotFoundError`.
- `Store(location, config)`, `connect_lancedb(location, config)`,
  `gather_database_info(location, config)` and `run_doctor(config, location, ...)`
  take the database location, a path or a URI. `ConnectionMode.of(location)`
  replaces `ConnectionMode.from_config`. `DatabaseRef.connection()` and
  `default_db_path` removed.

## [0.81.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- `search.vector_nprobes` (default 20) sets the IVF partitions each vector query searches.

### Documentation

- `docs/configuration/storage.md` "Vector Indexing" carries the measured with/without IVF_PQ retrieval comparison; `docs/benchmarks.md` states the published numbers are measured without a vector index.
- Re-indexing note corrected: `optimize()` adds new chunks to an existing vector index, a rebuild retrains centroids.

### Fixed

- Cross-database fusion without a reranker orders the union by cosine
  similarity to the query, with within-database rank breaking ties, instead
  of round-robin by database declaration order. Full-text-only searches order
  by retrieval score. Fused results carry the ordering score.

## [0.80.0] - 2026-08-31

### Changed

- lancedb 0.37.1.
- An invalid search `filter` raises `ValueError`.

### Added

- `--full-citations` on `haiku-rag ask` and `haiku-rag analyze` renders citation
  text untruncated. `format_citations_rich` takes a `full` argument.
- `doctor` fails when the chunks FTS index covers no rows.
- FTS and hybrid searches log a warning when the FTS index covers no rows.

### Removed

- `dot` removed from `search.vector_index_metric`; switch to `cosine` or `l2`
  and rerun `create-index`.

### Fixed

- FTS and hybrid search on a database whose FTS index covers no rows. Chunk
  writes now build the index and rebuild it if it covers none; `haiku-rag
  vacuum` also repairs it.
- Migration to 0.38.0 no longer fails with `UnicodeDecodeError` on a
  `docling_document` blob written as zstd.
- Vector search sets `search.vector_index_metric` on every query.

## [0.79.0] - 2026-08-28

### Changed

- Chat model provider `gemini` renamed to `google`, matching pydantic-ai. Update `provider: gemini` to `provider: google`.

### Added

- `lancedb.databases` configures a named set of local or remote databases.
  `search`, `ask` and `analyze` accept a `sources` subset; results, documents and
  citations carry the originating database in `source`, and model context names
  it as `Collection:` when a search spans more than one. Candidates are combined
  with the configured reranker, or reciprocal rank fusion when reranking is
  disabled. Operations that need one database raise `AmbiguousDatabaseError`, an
  unknown name raises `UnknownDatabaseError`, and a cited chunk ID retrieved from
  or previously cited from more than one selected database raises
  `AmbiguousCitationError`. An unavailable configured database raises
  `SourceUnavailableError`, which names the database and not its location.
- `haiku-rag search`, `ask`, `analyze` and `chat` cover a configured set.
  Commands that access one database select it with `--db-name NAME` or
  `--db PATH`.
- `HaikuRAG.aclose()` releases a client whatever it covers. `close()` remains
  limited to clients covering one database.

### Fixed

- `haiku-rag settings` prints YAML.
- The chat document filter pages results and lists the selected separately.
  Selection is by document ID and database, and a typed search applies on enter.
- `haiku-rag list` prints only the fields a document has.
- `haiku-rag` and `haiku-ingester` exit with a message on an embedder mismatch.
- Capabilities created without a client honor `lancedb.uri`.
- A `lancedb.uri` without a scheme is treated as a local path. `--db PATH`
  overrides it.
- Inspector search results mark truncated previews with an ellipsis.
- Document titles, URIs, headings and database names render as text, not Rich
  markup, in `search` output, chat citations and the chat document filter.
- `reranking.model.base_url` accepts the endpoint with or without the `/v1` path, matching the `vllm` embedder. Writing `/v1` produced a request to `/v1/v1/rerank`.
- An unrecognized chat model provider raises `Unknown model provider '<name>'` instead of reaching pydantic-ai as a `provider:name` string, and outranks the `api_key` check, so an unusable provider is no longer reported as a missing vendor environment variable.

## [0.78.0] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- `api_key` on model and embedding-model config, overriding the provider's environment variable. Honored on the `openai` and `ollama` providers, `vllm` embedders and rerankers, the picture-description VLM endpoint, and `doctor`'s endpoint probes; other providers raise.

### Fixed

- `doctor`'s docling-serve probe sends `X-Api-Key`, so an instance requiring a key is reported reachable rather than unreachable.
- The picture-description request to the public OpenAI endpoint sends `OPENAI_API_KEY`; it carried no authorization header.

## [0.77.0] - 2026-08-21

### Added

- The four capabilities support Pydantic AI agent specs via `from_spec`, registered with
  `Agent.from_spec(..., custom_capability_types=[...])`. `RAGCapability` and `AnalysisCapability` take
  `db_path`, `config`, `defer_loading`, `request_limit` and `vision`.

### Fixed

- `Store`, `HaikuRAG` and `create_capability` coerce a string `db_path` to `Path`, as the documented
  `HaikuRAG("knowledge.lancedb")` and `rag(db_path="my.lancedb")` forms require.
- A capability search that matches nothing returns `No results found.` instead of an empty string.
- Repeating a search query within a question accumulates the results of both calls instead of replacing the earlier ones.
- `file://` URIs resolve to a Windows path through `url2pathname`: `file:///C:/docs/a.pdf` was read as `\C:\docs\a.pdf`, so ingestion reported `File does not exist` for every discovered file. A URI authority is kept as a UNC server/share (`file://server/share/a.pdf`) except `localhost`, which is dropped.
- A Windows drive letter is no longer read as a URI scheme, so `C:\docs\a.pdf` is accepted by `create_document_from_source`, `convert` and `resolve_adhoc_fetcher`.
- `convert` and `check_source_accessible` decode percent-escapes in `file://` URIs, so a path containing `[`, `]` or a space resolves.

## [0.76.0] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- `haiku.rag.capabilities.EvidenceState`: the state base `RAGState` and `AnalysisState` derive from, with `begin_invocation()` for the per-question reset. `RAGCapabilityBase.evidence_record()` and `citation_index()` expose what a capability recorded, so a host reads it without reaching into `capability.state`.
- The `haiku.rag` package declares the `jina` extra, so `provider: jina-local` is supported by declaration rather than through `cross-encoder`'s transitive `transformers` and `torch`. Raises the full package's torch floor to 2.0.
- `providers.docling_serve.timeout` (default 300 seconds), forwarded to the docling-serve client's per-request timeout.

### Changed

- `haiku.rag.store.engine` split: table records, Arrow schemas, `index_specs`, `ensure_indexes`, `REQUIRED_TABLES` and `query_to_pydantic` are in `haiku.rag.store.schema`; `gather_database_info`, `get_database_stats`, `DatabaseInfo` and its result models are in `haiku.rag.store.info`. `Store` keeps lifecycle, locks, migration coordination, vacuuming and tags. Update imports.
- Source adapters moved from `haiku.rag.ingester.sources` to `haiku.rag.sources`: `FetchResult`, `SourceEvent`, `SourceEventKind`, `RevisionSnapshot`, `Source` and the `FSSource`/`HTTPSource`/`S3Source`/`WebDAVSource` adapters. One-shot client ingestion uses them too, so they were never ingester-only. Update imports; the `haiku.rag.sources` plugin entry-point group is unchanged.
- `HaikuRAG.convert(url)` fetches through `HTTPSource`, the same adapter the ingester uses, instead of its own httpx client. `_write_fetch_body` moved from `client.documents` to `client.processing`.
- Chunk embedding is owned by the persistence funnels: `create_document`, `update_document` and source ingestion no longer embed eagerly before handing chunks to a check that would embed them anyway. The `document.embed` span moved onto `ensure_chunks_embedded`, so every path is instrumented rather than only ingest.
- One-shot directory ingestion and `FSSource.discover` share `walk_files`, so the symlink-escape guard lives in one place.
- Configuration sections reject unknown keys. A typo or a setting that has been renamed or removed now fails validation with its path (`providers.docling_serve.bogus: Extra inputs are not permitted`) instead of being silently ignored.
- `processing.converter`, `processing.chunker` and `processing.chunker_type` are constrained to their supported values, so an unsupported one fails at load rather than at first use.
- Numeric settings carry bounds: sizes, limits, dimensions, token budgets, attempt counts, breaker thresholds and `min_chunks` must be positive; retention, delays, intervals and cooldowns non-negative; `doctor.duplicates.similarity_threshold` within 0-1; `ingester.api.port` within 0-65535 (0 keeps its OS-assigned meaning); `ingester.workers.worker_count` allows 0 for an API-and-reaper-only process.
- A configured reranker whose optional dependency is missing raises instead of silently disabling reranking, and names the extra to install (`uv pip install 'haiku.rag-slim[cohere]'`). A failure raised from inside an installed dependency propagates untouched rather than being reported as a missing package.
- Multi-table writes (document create, update, batch import, cascade delete) go through `Store.write_transaction()`. Rollback restores in `RESTORE_TABLE_ORDER` and is shielded from cancellation, so a cancelled write rolls back instead of committing part of itself. `Store.restore_table_versions()` is removed.

### Removed

- `haiku.rag.config.Config`, the eagerly loaded configuration instance. Use `get_config()` for the current global config, or pass an `AppConfig`. Every internal default (`get_embedder`, `get_converter`, `get_chunker`, `get_reranker`, `embed_chunks`, `HaikuRAG`, `Store`, `HaikuRAGApp`, `create_mcp_server`) now takes `config: AppConfig | None = None` and resolves it per call, so `set_config()` reaches them. `RerankerBase._model` no longer defaults to the configured reranker name; `CohereReranker` takes its model name as an argument.

### Fixed

- `haiku-rag settings` masked only top-level secret-named fields, printing nested ones in full (`lancedb.api_key`, `providers.docling_serve.api_key`, WebDAV source passwords). It redacts the whole dump.
- `haiku-rag chat` reports a missing `tui` extra instead of raising `ImportError`, matching `haiku-rag inspect`.
- `storage.data_dir: ""` resolves to the platform data directory, as documented; it coerced to `Path("")`, so the database was created in the process's working directory. Set `data_dir: .` to keep the old placement.
- Documented `search.limit` default is 5, was stated as 10.
- The documented way to disable reranking is omitting `reranking.model` or setting it to `null`; the previous `provider: ""` example raised `Unknown reranking provider`.
- `prompts.picture_description: null` is not valid; the documented example sets a string or omits the key.
- `create_document_from_source` closes the source adapter it builds for the call; adapters passed in through `sources` are left to their owner.
- Directory ingestion skips symlinked files resolving outside the given directory, matching `FSSource.discover`.
- A FULL rebuild no longer deletes a source-backed document before re-ingesting it: it refreshes the document in place, so the document id is preserved and a failed fetch or conversion falls back to rebuilding from stored content instead of losing the document.

## [0.75.0] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- `evaluations run --filter/-f CLAUSE`: SQL `WHERE` clause over document columns, applied to the retrieval benchmark's searches and to every capability search during QA. Recorded as `document_filter` in experiment metadata.
- `mtrag_clapnq` / `mtrag_clapnq_rewrite` / `mtrag_clapnq_live` / `mtrag_clapnq_live_uncompacted` evaluation datasets: multi-turn QA with gold-prefix and live-session conversation replay, live arms with and without `EvidenceCompactionCapability`, Recall@k/nDCG@k retrieval metrics, eligibility-aware citation scoring, refusal precision/recall, per-turn tool-traffic attributes, and `citation_status` / `turn_citation_status` eval attributes.
- Raw chunk metadata is now exposed to search and citation results, through `SearchResult.chunk_meta` and `Citation.chunk_meta`. For context-expanded results, the metadata is that of the anchor chunk.
- BTree indexes on `chunks.id`, `chunks.document_id` and `documents.id`, and a Bitmap index on `document_items.label`. Existing databases need `haiku-rag migrate`.
- `lancedb.read_consistency_interval_seconds` (default 30), `lancedb.index_cache_size_bytes` and `lancedb.metadata_cache_size_bytes`. The LanceDB session is shared across connections in a process, so its index and metadata caches survive a connection being closed.

### Changed

- Search enrichment, the multimodal reranker's picture fetch, and context expansion each issue a fixed number of `document_items` queries regardless of how many documents a result set spans, instead of one set per document. `expand_with_items` takes the items to expand from rather than fetching them, and `DocumentItemRepository` gains `resolve_refs_grouped`, `get_items_in_ranges`, `get_pictures_grouped` and `get_caption_picture_refs_grouped`. The superseded methods are removed: `resolve_refs`, `get_items_in_range`, `get_caption_picture_refs`, `get_text_for_refs` and `get_all_items_grouped`. `get_pictures_grouped` returns each picture's text alongside its bytes under `with_text`, off by default so the reranker's blob fetch does not read a column it discards.
- Eval judge pinned to `qwen3.8`: `DEFAULT_JUDGE_MODEL` is `ollama:qwen3.8`, and the reference configs use `Inferact/Qwen3.8-27B-NVFP4` with `extra_body.chat_template_kwargs.reasoning_effort: low`. Results in `docs/benchmarks.md` were judged by `Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-NVFP4` and are not re-judged.
- `create_capability(rag=...)` lends a capability an open client rather than having it open its own; `client.ask`/`client.analyze` now pass theirs.
- The MCP server opens one database client for its lifetime instead of one per tool call, and fails at startup if the database cannot be opened. `delete_document` no longer opens its own connection with `skip_validation=True`, so the server no longer opts out of embedding-config validation: drift that validation rejects (any `vector_dim` mismatch, or identity drift on a writable server) now fails MCP startup instead of serving a delete-only server. Use the CLI to delete under drift.
- `import_documents` embeds chunks across the whole batch in one pass instead of per document.
- `haiku.rag` and `haiku.rag-slim` summaries and keywords; both packages now publish `[project.urls]`.
- `server.json` declares `title` and `websiteUrl`, and drops the `keywords` and `license` keys, which are not in the server schema.

### Removed

- `wix` evaluation dataset and its reference config `evaluations/configs/wix.yaml`.

### Fixed

- `DocumentRepository.delete_all` recreated `document_items` from `DocumentItemRecord` instead of `get_document_items_arrow_schema()`, returning `picture_data` as `binary` rather than `large_binary`.
- `server.json` runtime arguments are `mcp --stdio`, was `serve --mcp`.

## [0.74.0] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- `CitationPolicyCapability` (`haiku.rag.capabilities.policy.create_capability`): registering it requires every answer to declare its grounding, in any conversation that has something to declare — this question retrieved evidence, or something was cited earlier. A question that ends undeclared is sent back once to record what grounded the answer already given, and is recorded in `CitationPolicyState.violations` if it finishes undeclared regardless. A conversation with neither a current-question evidence outcome nor any earlier citation is not enforced.
- `haiku.rag.capabilities.evidence.discover_evidence()` and `DiscoveredEvidence`, moved out of `compaction` so both optional capabilities share them. `RAGCapabilityBase.cite_available`.
- `EvidenceCompactionCapability` (`haiku.rag.capabilities.compaction.create_capability`): registering it replaces earlier questions' evidence on the model request with the evidence that was cited, grouped by the question that cited it, cited page images re-attached, other earlier evidence returns reduced to a receipt. Requests only; `all_messages()` is untouched. No configuration.
- `RAGState.evidence` / `AnalysisState.evidence` (`CapabilityEvidenceRecord`): which evidence a capability retrieved and cited, per question, keyed by message-count question identities and epochs, and whether that question is still being answered. `haiku.rag.capabilities.ledger.citation_status(records, question=...)` derives `missing` / `grounded` / `ungrounded` across capabilities.
- `RAGCapabilityBase.evidence_tool_names()` and `get_picture_bytes()`.
- `haiku.rag.tools.search.decode_picture()`.

### Changed

- `rag_cite` / `analysis_cite` accept an empty `chunk_ids`, recording the answer as ungrounded rather than failing the call, and the instructions no longer exempt a refusal or a corpus-level computation from citing.
- `RAGCapability` and `AnalysisCapability` no longer rewrite the model request. Register `create_capability()` from `haiku.rag.capabilities.compaction` alongside them to keep earlier questions compacted.
- Resuming a run (deferred tool results, an unfinished history tail) raises `RuntimeError` unless the host carries the capability state from the run being resumed.

### Removed

- `PRIOR_TURN_NOTICE` and `_compact_old_tool_returns` from `haiku.rag.capabilities._base`, and `RAGCapabilityBase.turn_start`.

### Fixed

- `rag_cite` and `analysis_cite` no longer ask for another call when a call resolved some ids and not others.
- `cross-encoder` reranking no longer ties the scores of strongly-relevant candidates, which left their order to the sort. Scores remain 0-1.
- `haiku-rag` and `haiku-ingester` CLI startup no longer imports `lancedb`, `pyarrow` and `pydantic_ai`.
- `haiku.rag.store` no longer re-exports `Store`; import it from `haiku.rag.store.engine`.
- `docling-local` reuses one docling `DocumentConverter` per set of conversion options instead of building one per document, so local layout, table and OCR models are no longer loaded per document. Conversions through a shared converter are serialized.
- A resumed run keeps the searches, citations and executions of the question in progress instead of clearing them.
- Each page image attached to a search result is preceded by a line giving its position and the chunk id it came from. `build_binary_parts_from_results` is now `build_image_content_from_results` and returns those labels interleaved with the pictures.

## [0.73.0] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- `evaluations run` records `judge_extra_body`, `qa_extra_body` and `capability_extra_body` in experiment metadata.

### Changed

- `get_document_by_id` / `get_document_by_uri` no longer load the docling structure and page-image blobs. Load them with `DocumentRepository.get_docling_data` / `get_pages_data`, or `get_by_id(..., include_blobs=True)`.
- Pinned judge sampling in every reference config under `evaluations/configs/` whose dataset is judged: `temperature` 0.6, `max_tokens` 16384, `extra_body` `top_p` 0.95 / `top_k` 20 / `min_p` 0 / `chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking` true. `DEFAULT_JUDGE_MODEL` takes `temperature` 0.6, `max_tokens` 16384 and `top_p` 0.95, the subset ollama honours.
- Reranker in the `orb_text`, `wix` and `t2_finqa` reference configs and in the reranking provider docs: `mixedbread-ai/mxbai-rerank-base-v2` → `Qwen/Qwen3-Reranker-4B` on the `vllm` provider.

### Fixed

- Ingester jobs failing with an `obstore` `PermissionDeniedError`, `UnauthenticatedError`, `UnknownConfigurationKeyError` or `InvalidPathError` are dead-lettered instead of retried to `max_attempts`.

## [0.72.1] - 2026-07-31

### Changed

- `list_documents(include_content=True)` returns `content` only; the docling structure and page-image blobs are no longer loaded by a listing.

## [0.72.0] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- `evaluations run` records `cited_chunk_ids`, `searched_uris`, `n_searches`, `n_search_calls`, `n_rejected_searches`, `n_failed_tools`, `n_executions` and `n_requests` as eval attributes alongside `cited_uris`.

### Changed

- A capability whose search or code-execution budget is spent says so in its instructions on every following request, naming the exhausted tools.

### Fixed

- A failed `analysis_execute_code` call that iterated a file object reports the `.readlines()` workaround alongside the `TypeError`.
- A capability that reaches its request limit keeps its cite tool for two further requests that call one of its tools, while its other tools are removed.
- A cited chunk id that does not match a retrieved id exactly resolves to the closest one above a 0.75 similarity cutoff.
- Dotfiles are parsed as their actual format instead of a single unstructured text block. Docling ignores the extension of a name starting with a dot, so converters strip leading dots from the name they hand it.

### Documentation

- `qa.max_searches` is documented as defaulting to 5 in `docs/configuration/qa.md` and `docs/configuration/index.md`, was 3.
- New "Vacuum Memory Requirements" subsection in `docs/configuration/storage.md` documenting the ~5x peak memory of vacuum compaction relative to the `documents` table, the mitigations, and upstream issue lancedb/lancedb#2325.

## [0.71.0] - 2026-07-29

### Added

- Analysis sandbox supports `open()` and `with` blocks for reading document files, including `.read()`, `.readline()`, and `.readlines()`.

### Changed

- Require `pydantic-ai-slim>=2.18,<3`.
- `pydantic-monty` bumped to `>=0.0.19`; sandbox code now runs in a subprocess worker pool. A crashed or timed-out worker fails one call and the next call gets a replacement session.
- The analysis sandbox gives Monty a duration budget of `analysis.code_timeout * analysis.max_executions` for the session, was `analysis.code_timeout`.
- `enable_thinking` maps onto Pydantic AI's unified `thinking` setting for the `anthropic`, `gemini`, `groq` and `bedrock` providers. The Anthropic thinking budget is now Pydantic AI's default of 10000 tokens, was 4096, and `max_tokens` must exceed it on budget-based Claude models; `enable_thinking: false` disables Gemini thinking rather than only hiding thoughts; Groq maps reasoning effort rather than `groq_reasoning_format`; Bedrock Qwen with `enable_thinking: false` no longer sends `reasoning_config`, while Bedrock-served Claude keeps an explicit `thinking: disabled`. The `openai` and `ollama` providers still map to `openai_reasoning_effort`.
- `provider: bedrock` with a proprietary OpenAI model such as `openai.o3-mini-v1:0` raises `UserError`: Bedrock Converse serves only the `gpt-oss` family. Use `provider: bedrock-mantle`.
- Tool failures raise `pydantic_ai.ToolFailed` instead of returning failure text: search and code-execution limits, sandbox execution errors, and `get_document`/`summarize_document` misses.

### Fixed

- `Store.set_haiku_version` stamps the store's own config into a recreated settings row instead of the process-global `Config`.
- `check_source_accessible` returns `False` for a URI it cannot resolve (unparseable host, unreadable path) instead of raising and aborting a full rebuild.
- `evaluations run` opens the database read-only outside the population phase, so an embedder identity differing from the stored one warns instead of aborting the run.
- `docs/installation.md` documents the `jina`, `s3` and `ingester` extras, names the extras the full package actually pulls, drops the removed MixedBread AI reranker, and no longer lists Anthropic as a built-in provider.
- `docs/tuning.md` no longer points at the removed `claim_timeout_s` setting.
- `analysis.code_timeout` is enforced before each document read, bounding a call that reads in a loop.
- `metadata.json` in the document VFS rejects writes, matching `content.txt`, `items.jsonl` and `toc.json`.

### Removed

- `SettingsRepository.create`, `get_by_id`, `update`, `delete`, `list_all` and `ChunkRepository.update`, `delete`, `get_chunks_in_range`.

## [0.70.0] - 2026-07-25

### Added

- `HaikuRAG.ask` and `HaikuRAG.analyze` accept `images: Sequence[bytes]`, attached to the question as model input; requires `vision: true` on the driving model.
- `haiku-rag ask` and `haiku-rag analyze` accept `--image PATH` (repeatable).
- MCP `ask_question` and `analyze` tools accept `images_base64`.
- Chat TUI: `Ctrl+I` opens an image picker; attached images insert `[Image #N]` tokens in a multi-line prompt and are sent to the model with the message.

### Fixed

- Chat and inspector TUIs report the actual database-open error instead of an `AttributeError` from teardown.

## [0.69.0] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- Native deferred Pydantic AI `RAGCapability` and `AnalysisCapability` implementations under `haiku.rag.capabilities`, with namespaced host state and lazy per-run database and sandbox resources.
- Prior-turn RAG and analysis tool results are compacted before model requests while current-turn evidence remains intact.
- Per-question capability request limits force a final answer from gathered evidence by removing only the exhausted capability's tools; unrelated agent and capability tools remain available.

### Changed

- Require `pydantic-ai-slim>=2.11,<3`; the `vertexai` optional extra now installs Pydantic AI's `google` extra.
- The chat TUI consumes native Pydantic AI stream events. The web example uses the standard `AGUIAdapter` and emits one final state snapshot instead of forwarding sub-agent activity and per-tool state events.
- Chat capability selection is now `haiku-rag chat --capability/-c {rag,analysis}`. Migrate from `--skill/-s`.
- Evaluation targets are now `rag-capability` and `analysis-capability`, and the model override is `--capability-model`. Migrate from `rag-skill`, `analysis-skill`, and `--skill-model`.

### Removed

- The `haiku.skills` dependency, `haiku.rag.skills` modules, Python entry-point discovery, and sub-agent execution layer. Migrate `create_skill(...)` plus `SkillToolset` usage to `haiku.rag.capabilities.*.create_capability(...)` passed through `Agent(capabilities=[...])`.
- The `haiku-rag create-skill` package generator. Compose native capabilities directly and package application-specific instructions and data in the consuming project.
- Legacy sub-agent `ActivitySnapshotEvent` plumbing and per-tool `StateDeltaEvent` generation.

## [0.68.0] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- `reranking.multimodal` config flag: picture chunks are sent to a vllm reranker as image documents.

### Fixed

- `list`, `get`, and `visualize` no longer require an embeddings config matching the database.

## [0.67.3] - 2026-07-23

### Changed

- Security dependency updates: pillow 12.3.0, mcp 1.28.1, pydantic-ai 1.102.0, torch 2.13.0, transformers 5.5.0, soupsieve 2.9.1, joserfc 1.7.4, pyasn1 0.6.4, setuptools 83.0.0; frontend next 16.2.11, sharp 0.35.3, fast-uri 3.1.4, dompurify 3.4.12, body-parser 1.20.6.

## [0.67.2] - 2026-07-23

### Added

- `SearchResult.document_meta` and `Citation.document_meta` carry the parent document's metadata.

## [0.67.1] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- `hotpotqa` evaluation dataset.

### Changed

- `cite` skill tool names unresolvable chunk ids in its response when at least one id resolves.

### Fixed

- Document deletion no longer raises `ConfigMismatchError` on embedding config drift.

## [0.67.0] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- Database tags: `haiku-rag tag create/list/delete/restore`, tags shown in `history`. `tag restore` creates a `before-restore-*` safety tag before changing live state. Vacuum retains versions back to the oldest tag.

### Changed

- `lancedb` bumped to 0.34.0.

### Removed

- `--before` global flag and the `before` constructor arguments on `HaikuRAG`, `Store`, `HaikuRAGApp`, `ChatApp`/`run_chat`, and `InspectorApp`/`run_inspector`. There is no read-only replacement; create tags prospectively before important changes and use `tag restore` during a maintenance window.

### Fixed

- `docling-local` text conversion no longer misroutes markdown/HTML content whose first bytes collide with a binary magic signature (e.g. `BM`, `ID3`) to an image or audio backend.

## [0.66.0] - 2026-07-14

### Changed

- Unknown `reranking.model.provider` raises `ValueError` instead of silently disabling reranking.
- `search.max_context_chars` default lowered from 10000 to 5000.

### Removed

- `mxbai` reranking provider and extra; the `transformers<5.0.0` cap goes with it. Migrate to `provider: cross-encoder` with the same model name (`mixedbread-ai/mxbai-rerank-base-v2`), installed via the `cross-encoder` extra.

### Fixed

- Context expansion no longer drops a retrieved result from a merged group when clipping to `search.max_context_chars`; groups whose clip would evict a constituent's evidence are returned as separate expanded results.
- Context expansion now fills missing page metadata from input search results when the referenced items survive in the expanded result.

## [0.65.1] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- `debug-evals` and `debug-ingestion` Claude skills (`.claude/skills/`) with canned Logfire queries for eval-run and ingestion debugging.

### Changed

- Logfire spans carry `service.version` and a per-process `service.name` (`haiku-ingester`, `haiku-rag`, `haiku-rag-app`); `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` / `LOGFIRE_SERVICE_NAME` override the default.
- Each docling-serve request emits a `docling_serve.request` span carrying the instance `url` and `attempt`.
- The ingester worker circuit breaker opening emits a `ingester.worker breaker opened` Logfire event with `source_id`, `threshold`, `cooldown_s`.

## [0.65.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- `SearchResult.chunk_ids` and `Citation.chunk_ids` carry the chunk ids merged into an expanded result.
- `Citation.doc_item_refs` carries the items the model saw; `visualize_chunk` accepts a `refs` argument and resolves bounding boxes from them, so visualizations match the cited content instead of re-expanding.
- Chunk visualizations draw matched content in a stronger highlight than surrounding context.
- `haiku-rag visualize --no-expand` highlights only the chunk itself, without its expanded context (`visualize_chunk` gains an `expand` argument).

### Changed

- Duplicate images within a document produce a single picture chunk.
- Pictures smaller than `processing.min_picture_size` pixels on the smaller side (default 64) no longer become picture chunks; `0` disables the filter.

### Fixed

- vLLM embedding and vLLM/Jina reranking reuse one HTTP client across requests instead of opening one per request.
- Picture and table search hits expand within their section, never across section boundaries.
- A merged search result anchors its `chunk_id` on the highest-scoring constituent chunk instead of the one earliest in the document.
- A clipped citation's `page_numbers` and `doc_item_refs` reflect only the content that survived the budget, not the full expanded range.

## [0.64.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added

- `update_document` accepts a `uri` argument to change a document's URI.
- docling-serve requests fail over to another instance on transport/5xx errors and skip instances whose circuit breaker is open; tune via `providers.docling_serve.max_attempts` and `providers.docling_serve.circuit_breaker`.

### Fixed

- Concurrent ingestion of the same URI no longer creates duplicate documents; the URI is re-checked under the write lock and a colliding create becomes an update.
- Document filters can reference `id` (`list_documents`/`count_documents`/`search`/`analyze` `filter=`); the `document_meta` identity column is renamed `document_id` → `id` with a migration.

## [0.63.2] - 2026-07-03

### Changed

- Custom rerankers override `RerankerBase._rerank` instead of `rerank`; the base `rerank` handles the empty-input short-circuit.

### Fixed

- A search result whose matched refs include a figure's caption now attaches that figure's picture bytes for vision-capable models, resolved through the caption's adjacent picture item.

## [0.63.1] - 2026-06-29

### Changed

- Require `haiku.skills>=0.18.0`.

### Added

- `orb_multimodal_nemotron` pre-built evaluation database (`nvidia/llama-nemotron-embed-vl-1b-v2` embedder).
- `t2_finqa` pre-built evaluation database (T²-RAGBench FinQA).
- Reference configs under `evaluations/configs/` for the pre-built evaluation databases (`wix`, `orb_text`, `orb_multimodal`, `orb_multimodal_nemotron`, `t2_finqa`).

## [0.63.0] - 2026-06-28

### Added

- `doctor` shows a spinner naming the check currently in progress while it runs.

### Changed

- `doctor` near-duplicate detection compares whole-document embedding centroids instead of per-chunk overlap, and no longer flags a small document contained in a larger one. The per-chunk check could take hours and tens of GB of memory on corpora with large documents. The centroid check is independent of document size and reduces each document to a centroid during the vector scan without a second copy of the matrix.
- **Breaking:** the `doctor.duplicates` keys `containment_threshold`, `candidate_threshold`, and `twin_similarity` are replaced by a single `similarity_threshold` (default `0.97`). `min_chunks` is unchanged.
- `doctor --duplicates-out` YAML reports `similarity` per document instead of `contained_fraction`.

## [0.62.1] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed

- Context expansion now hard-caps each expanded search result at `search.max_context_chars`, anchored on the matched chunk. A single oversized `document_items` row (e.g. a spreadsheet converted to one table) no longer pushes a result far past the budget and overflows the model context window.

## [0.62.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added

- `doctor` reports groups of near-duplicate documents (revisions sharing most of their chunks), flagging the largest member as the likely one to keep; `--duplicates-out PATH` writes the groups to a YAML file. Tuned via the `doctor.duplicates` config block (`containment_threshold`, `candidate_threshold`, `twin_similarity`, `min_chunks`).

### Security

- Bumped dependencies in `uv.lock` to patched versions for known advisories: `aiohttp` 3.14.1, `cryptography` 49.0.0, `idna` 3.18, `langchain-core` 1.4.8, `langchain-text-splitters` 1.1.2, `langsmith` 0.9.1, `lxml` 6.1.1, `pillow` 12.2.0, `pydantic-settings` 2.14.2, `pyjwt` 2.13.0, `pytest` 9.1.1, `python-multipart` 0.0.32, `requests` 2.34.2, `starlette` 1.3.1, `urllib3` 2.7.0, `vcrpy` 8.2.1.
- `app/frontend`: bumped `next` to 16.2.9 and `@copilotkit/*` to 1.61.1 (clearing their transitive advisories) and added `openai` (now a peer dependency of `@copilotkit/runtime`).

### Changed

- Ingester reaping is lease-based: a worker renews `last_heartbeat_at` on its in-flight jobs every `heartbeat_interval_s`, and the reaper reclaims a claim only once its lease is older than `lease_ttl_s`. A job slower than the timeout is no longer reaped and reprocessed while still running. Adds queue schema v2 (`last_heartbeat_at` on `jobs`); existing queue databases migrate in place on open.
- **Breaking:** `ingester.workers.claim_timeout_s` removed; set `lease_ttl_s` (default 120) and `heartbeat_interval_s` (default 30) instead. `WorkerConfig` rejects unknown keys.
- A bare `${VAR}` in YAML config now raises `MissingEnvVarError` when the variable is set but empty, matching the unset case. Use `${VAR:-default}` to allow an empty/absent value.

### Fixed

- A failed FTS index build is logged at `WARNING` instead of `DEBUG`, so silent full-text search degradation is visible.
- Ingester worker ids are now globally unique (`{pid}-{uuid}-{n}`); the `claimed_by` guards on job completion/reschedule/release distinguish workers across processes sharing one Postgres queue.

## [0.61.2] - 2026-06-24

### Fixed

- `fastmcp` is now a direct dependency instead of being pulled via the `pydantic-ai-slim[fastmcp]` extra, which `pydantic-ai-slim` 2.0 dropped. Clean installs resolving that release got only `fastmcp-slim` (client), so `haiku-rag mcp` failed with `ImportError: FastMCP server support is not installed`.

## [0.61.1] - 2026-06-24

### Fixed

- zstd compression uses a fresh `zstandard` compressor/decompressor per call instead of shared module-level singletons, fixing process segfaults when ingester workers compress documents concurrently (Python < 3.14).
- Ingestion compresses the DoclingDocument structure directly from the in-memory dict, removing one full-size serialized copy from per-document peak memory.
- Document item extraction builds one `MarkdownDocSerializer` per document (reused across tables) and derives description-less picture text from captions, instead of constructing a serializer per picture and table.

## [0.61.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- `haiku-rag doctor` checks a database for consistency (orphaned chunks/items, chunk-less documents classified by content and embedder modality, dangling `doc_item_refs`, vector-dimension mismatch, unembedded chunks, missing picture data, settings/embedding drift, pending migrations, vector-index coverage, provider API keys) and probes configured provider endpoints (Ollama `/api/tags` with model presence, docling-serve `/health`, OpenAI-compatible/vLLM `/models`); exits 1 when any check fails.
- `embeddings.model.multimodal` (bool, default false) gates image embedding; `supports_images` derives from it instead of the provider name.
- VoyageAI multimodal embedder (`provider: voyageai`, `multimodal: true`, e.g. `voyage-multimodal-3`) embedding text and pictures into a shared vector space.
- Cohere multimodal embedder (`provider: cohere`, `multimodal: true`, e.g. `embed-v4.0`) embedding text and pictures into a shared vector space.

### Changed

- `provider: vllm` is text-only unless `embeddings.model.multimodal: true` is set. Existing multimodal vLLM configs must add the flag; `multimodal` is not part of the stored embedding identity, so changing it raises no drift error — re-ingest or `rebuild` to add or drop picture chunks.

### Fixed

- More CPU-bound steps run off the event loop: docling item extraction, local chunking, rebuild picture-description patching, and picture-chunk merging no longer stall concurrent workers on large documents.
- `docling-serve` converter requests `include_page_images`, so `generate_page_images` produces page rasters on docling-serve versions that gate them behind that flag.
- `docling-serve` chunker stores chunk bodies via `raw_text`, so section headings aren't duplicated into chunk content on docling-serve versions where the chunk `text` field is heading-contextualized.

## [0.60.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- `haiku-ingester run-batch --dry-run` writes a YAML manifest of planned upserts/deletes without mutating queue jobs or `sync_state`; `run-batch --manifest <path>` replays that frozen changeset without another discovery sweep.
- `haiku-ingester run-batch` and `run-batch --manifest` show an interactive progress bar with ETA while draining queued jobs.

### Fixed

- CPU-bound ingest steps now run off the event loop: Docling document serialization, docling-serve zip parsing, split-PDF concatenation, fetched-body temp writes, and filesystem read/hash work no longer stall concurrent ingester workers on large image-bearing documents.

## [0.59.1] - 2026-06-19

### Changed

- `textual-image` moved to base dependencies; `ask`/`analyze`/`visualize` render image citations without the `tui` extra.

### Fixed

- Embedded-PDF attachment scanning runs in a worker thread instead of on the event loop; ingesting PDFs with embedded attachments no longer stalls concurrent workers.

## [0.59.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added

- Custom ingester sources: a source config with `type: plugin` names a source factory registered under the `haiku.rag.sources` entry-point group via its `plugin` field, with an opaque `options` mapping the plugin validates itself. Only the referenced plugin is imported.

### Changed

- Bump `docling>=2.102.2,<3.0.0` and `docling-core>=2.82.0,<3.0.0`; the `<3.0.0` cap holds the DoclingDocument schema at 1.10.0.
- Relax `opencv-python-headless` to `>=4.6.0.66,<5.0.0.0` (was `>=4.13.0.92`) to match `docling-ibm-models`' declared range.
- `haiku.rag.metadata_providers` callables take a third argument, the fetched `FetchResult`: `__call__(source_id, uri, result)`. The provider runs after fetch instead of before; on revision-unchanged sweeps it is skipped and existing provider metadata is preserved.

### Fixed

- SQLite ingester queue runs with a multi-connection pool (`pool_size=5, max_overflow=5`) instead of a single connection. API reads (`/stats`, `/jobs`) no longer time out with `QueuePool limit of size 1 reached` while workers hold the connection.
- Permanently-failed ingester documents (revisioned sources) record their revision in `sync_state`, so discovery no longer re-enqueues them every sweep; re-attempted only when the file's revision changes or via explicit retry/rebuild.
- Retrying a dead ingester job (`/jobs/{id}/retry`, `/dlq/{id}/retry`) when a live job already exists for the same `(source_id, uri)` returns the live job instead of failing with a 500 (`uq_jobs_live` violation).

## [0.58.0] - 2026-06-15

### Added

- Ingester metadata providers: a source config's `metadata_provider` names a callable registered under the `haiku.rag.metadata_providers` entry-point group; the ingester calls it per document with `(source_id, uri)` and attaches the returned dict as document metadata. System-derived keys (`md5`, `source_revision`, `content_type`) take precedence on collision.

### Changed

- Mutable document attributes (`uri`, `title`, `metadata`, `created_at`, `updated_at`) moved from the `documents` table into a new `document_meta` table (1:1 on `document_id`); metadata/title/`source_revision` updates no longer rewrite the docling blobs. Migration `v0_58_0` relocates existing data and runs a one-time `vacuum` to reclaim prior bloat.
- Background auto-vacuum is throttled to at most once per 5 minutes; a final vacuum on close collapses any throttled writes. Sustained ingestion no longer triggers back-to-back compaction of the `documents` table.

### Fixed

- WebDAV source follows HTTP redirects (`PROPFIND` and `GET`); front-ended servers that 301/302 on trailing-slash or virtual-host rewrites no longer error.
- All in-process pdfium access (page slicing and embedded-attachment scanning) is serialized under a single shared lock. Concurrent ingester workers no longer corrupt libpdfium's global state, which previously failed valid PDFs with "Data format error".
- Embedded PDF attachment extension is derived from the attachment filename, not the parent's synthetic `...#attachment=<name>` URI; non-PDF attachments (e.g. `.joboptions`) are no longer misrouted to docling's PDF backend, and unsupported extensions are skipped.

## [0.57.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- `ingester.api.root_path` (and `haiku-ingester serve --root-path`) serves the control plane under a sub-path for reverse-proxying; forwarded to FastAPI/uvicorn `root_path` and reflected in the dashboard's `<base href>`.
- YAML config string values support `${VAR}` / `${VAR:-default}` environment-variable interpolation, expanded at load time. `${VAR}` referencing an unset variable raises `MissingEnvVarError`; `$$` is a literal `$`.

## [0.56.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added

- Ingester control plane gains `GET /database` (LanceDB snapshot: stored version, embeddings, per-table counts/sizes, vector index, pending migrations, package versions — the data `haiku-rag info` prints) and `GET /config` (full effective config as YAML, secrets redacted). The dashboard surfaces both as on-demand collapsible Database and Configuration panels.
- `HaikuRAG.import_documents(imports)` batch-imports prepared documents (`DocumentImport`), writing the `documents`, `chunks`, and `document_items` tables once each regardless of batch size. `DocumentRepository.create` accepts `Document | list[Document]`.

### Changed

- Ingester control-plane per-request access logs are emitted only when the `haiku.rag` logger is at DEBUG.

### Fixed

- Ingester worker circuit breaker is now per-source: a streak of transient failures pauses claims only for the affected source's jobs while healthy sources keep flowing, instead of pausing the whole worker pool. Paused sources are excluded at the claim query.

## [0.55.1] - 2026-06-08

### Changed

- Bump `haiku.skills>=0.17.2`: skill runs use a retry budget of 3 for tool calls and output validation (was 1).
- Evaluations disable Logfire scrubbing (`scrubbing=False`) so financial answers containing words like "authorized" aren't redacted from logged outputs.

### Added

- `analysis.max_executions` (default 15): caps `execute_code` calls per analysis question. Past the cap the tool returns a notice telling the skill to answer from what it has, instead of spiralling into `request_limit` and returning nothing. The analysis skill sets `request_limit` to 30 as a backstop.
- `t2_finqa` and `t2_tatdqa` evaluation datasets (T²-RAGBench subsets, `G4KMU/t2-ragbench`): financial-report PDFs ingested via docling with `uri = context_id` and gold retrieval keyed on `context_id`. QA is scored with a deterministic `NumberMatchEvaluator` (relative tolerance 0.01) via the new `DatasetSpec.qa_evaluator`, bypassing the LLM judge.
- `evaluations run --filter-ids <file>`: run QA on just the case ids listed in a file (failure-subset rerun); retrieval is unaffected.
- `evaluations/scripts/build_t2_submission.py` + `evaluations.submission`: build a T²-RAGBench leaderboard submission JSONL (`{id, subset, context_id, prediction}`) by joining QA predictions with retrieval rankings by question.

### Fixed

- Skill tools (`search`/`cite`/`list_documents`/`get_document`) and the analysis sandbox serialize access to the shared LanceDB connection through one lock, so a turn's concurrently executed tool calls no longer trigger `RuntimeError: Already borrowed`.

## [0.55.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- `haiku-rag rebuild --set-embedder`: adopt the current embedder identity (provider/name) without re-embedding, when the vector dimension is unchanged.

### Fixed

- Opening a database no longer writes to it: reads no longer rewrite the stored embedding settings or change the stored version, and the version is never downgraded. Embedding provider/name drift (matching `vector_dim`) warns on read-only opens and raises `ConfigMismatchError` on writable opens; reconcile with `rebuild --set-embedder`.
- Read CLI verbs (`list`, `get`, `search`, `visualize`, `ask`, `analyze`, `inspect`, `chat`, `info`, `history`) open the database read-only.
- Analysis-skill `execute_code` no longer crashes with LanceDB `Already borrowed` when sandboxed code reads the document VFS (`content.txt`, `items.jsonl`, `toc.json`); reads run on one background event loop with a single read-only connection for the sandbox's lifetime.

## [0.54.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added

- `ingester.queue.dburi`: a SQLAlchemy async URL (e.g. `postgresql+asyncpg://user:pw@host/db`) points the ingester queue at a database server. SQLite remains the default when unset. The Postgres path claims jobs with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, so multiple ingester processes can share one queue.

## [0.53.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- `ingester.queue.retention_days` (default 30): the reaper deletes succeeded/dead jobs whose `completed_at` is older than the window. `null` disables pruning.

### Fixed

- `rebuild --embed-only` re-embeds picture chunks through the image path instead of overwriting their vectors with a text embedding of the caption.
- DELETE jobs re-check the source with `head()` before deleting and skip when the resource is back, so an atomic-rename save (vim, `git checkout`) no longer blackholes a live document.

## [0.52.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- `haiku-ingester run-batch`: one discover sweep across every configured source, drains the queue, then exits. Orphan deletion requires a persisted `ingester.db`.
- `max_file_size` (bytes) on every source type rejects oversized files before they are read into memory; they dead-letter as a permanent `FileTooLargeError`. FS and S3 check the size from metadata before fetching; HTTP and WebDAV rely on a `Content-Length` response header, so a server that omits it is not enforced.

### Changed

- Idle workers wake on enqueue via an `asyncio.Condition` instead of polling on `poll_idle_interval_s`.
- `sync_state` writes are batched into one transaction per sweep (`SyncStateRepo.batch_upsert`) instead of one commit per file.
- HTTP and WebDAV sources reuse a single `httpx.AsyncClient` across `head`/`fetch`/`discover` instead of opening one per request.
- Periodic poll sweeps start after a random jitter of 0–25% of `poll_interval_s`.
- New partial index `idx_jobs_succeeded_completed` backs the dashboard rolling-throughput query.

### Removed

- `haiku-ingester run-once`. Use `run-batch` to ingest configured sources, or `serve` for continuous operation.

### Fixed

- Revision-less HTTP/S3/WebDAV resources (no ETag or Last-Modified) emit `UNCHANGED` once known instead of re-ingesting on every sweep.
- Deleted, unreadable, and directory paths (`FileNotFoundError`, `PermissionError`, `IsADirectoryError`, `NotADirectoryError`) classify as permanent failures instead of exhausting retries first.
- FS `discover()` and the watch loop no longer crash when a file is removed between listing and `stat()`.
- HTTP `discover()` catches only `httpx.TransportError`; other exceptions propagate instead of being emitted as UPSERT.
- A `sync_state` write that fails after a job is marked succeeded is logged instead of crashing the worker.

## [0.51.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- PDF `/EmbeddedFiles` attachments are ingested as separate Documents linked to the wrapper through `metadata.parent_uri`. Child URIs use a `#attachment=<percent-encoded-name>` fragment on the parent URI. Re-ingest reconciles the child set (add / update / delete) against the wrapper's current attachments; `delete_document` cascades through `parent_uri`. Nested chains are bounded at 3 levels. Toggle with `processing.extract_pdf_attachments` (default `true`).

### Changed

- A successful DELETE job auto-prunes dead jobs with the same `(source_id, uri)`. New `JobRepo.prune_dead(source_id, uri)`.
- Reranker built once per `HaikuRAG` client instead of per `search()` call.
- Embedder built once per `HaikuRAG` client instead of rebuilt per ingest/search operation. `embed_chunks` now takes it explicitly: `embed_chunks(chunks, embedder, config)` (was `embed_chunks(chunks, config)`). New `HaikuRAG.embedder` property exposes it.
- `HaikuRAG` close runs a final vacuum after draining in-flight background vacuums when `storage.auto_vacuum` is enabled.

## [0.50.0] - 2026-05-27

### Added

- `haiku-ingester` service for continuous document ingestion. Persistent SQLite job queue, async worker pool with retries and dead-letter queue, FS/HTTP/S3/WebDAV source adapters, per-source and pool-wide circuit breakers, and a FastAPI control plane on `127.0.0.1:8765` exposing `/health`, `/sources`, `/jobs`, `/dlq`, `/stats`, and a browser dashboard at `/`. Configured under `ingester:` in `haiku.rag.yaml`; shipped behind the `[ingester]` extra. See [docs/ingester.md](docs/ingester.md).
- `processing.split_pages` (default `0`): split PDFs into N-page slices, convert each, merge via `DoclingDocument.concatenate()`. `0` disables.
- Logfire spans for ingestion: `ingester.poller.sweep`, `ingester.poller.watch_event`, `ingester.job`, `document.{fetch,convert,chunk,embed,store}`, `document.convert_slice`.

### Removed

- File monitor (`haiku.rag.monitor`, `MonitorConfig`, `S3MonitorEntry`, `AppConfig.monitor`, `haiku-rag serve --monitor`). Migrate `monitor.directories` to `ingester.sources[type=fs]` and `monitor.s3` to `ingester.sources[type=s3]`.

### Changed

- `haiku-rag serve` renamed to `haiku-rag mcp`. `--mcp-port` renamed to `--port`.
- `document.metadata` keys renamed: `etag` → `source_revision`, `contentType` → `content_type`. v0.50.0 startup migration rewrites existing documents and compacts the `documents` table at the end (12 GB → 25 GB mid-migration on a 1000-doc PDF corpus, reclaimed back to 12 GB).
- `providers.docling_serve.base_url` now accepts a list. Jobs round-robin across the entries; each job's submit/poll/result pinned to one instance.
- `DoclingServeClient.submit_and_poll` and `submit_and_poll_zip` no longer wrap `httpx` errors into `ValueError`. `httpx.ConnectError`, `HTTPStatusError`, `TimeoutException`, etc. propagate with their type intact.
- Logfire spans report `instrumentation_scope.name = "haiku.rag"` (was the SDK default `logfire`).
- Default RAG skill exposes only `search` and `cite`. `list_documents` and `get_document` are still available in `create_skill_tools` and `skill_generator`'s `AVAILABLE_TOOLS` for custom skills.

## [0.48.1] - 2026-05-21

### Changed

- Bump `haiku.skills>=0.17.1` and `pydantic-ai-slim>=1.100.0` (the last pre-2.0 release). Migrate off two APIs slated for removal in pydantic-ai 2.0: `Agent(tool_retries=, output_retries=)` → `Agent(retries={"tools": …, "output": …})` in the LLM-as-judge evaluator, and `Evaluator.evaluation_name` class attribute → overriding `get_default_evaluation_name()` on `CitationMRREvaluator` / `CitationMAPEvaluator`.
- Drop the `item.annotations` fallback in `_picture_description_text`. Docling's `PictureItem` runs a `@model_validator(mode="after")` on load that migrates the deprecated `annotations` field into `meta.description`, so reading `meta.description.text` covers both legacy and current blobs. Tests in `test_converters.py` switched to `meta.description.text` for the same reason.
- Chat TUI now generates a stable per-launch `thread_id` (rotated on "Clear chat") instead of hardcoding `"tui"`. AGUIAdapter forwards it as the `gen_ai.conversation.id` OTel attribute, so multi-turn TUI sessions group into one Logfire conversation instead of collapsing every launch into a single bucket.
- Documentation generator swapped from `mkdocs-material` to `zensical`. Drops `mkdocs` / `mkdocs-material` dev deps, replaces `mkdocs.yml` with `zensical.toml`, adds `overrides/main.html` (OG/Twitter share meta) and `docs/stylesheets/extra.css`. `build-docs` workflow now runs `uv run zensical build` and publishes via the GitHub Pages artifact actions instead of `mkdocs gh-deploy`.

### Fixed

- mxbai reranker crashing inside the chat TUI with `ValueError: bad value(s) in fds_to_keep`. tqdm constructs a `multiprocessing.RLock` on first use, whose `resource_tracker` spawn picks up `sys.stderr.fileno()`; Textual's redirected stderr returns `-1`, failing the `fork_exec` validation. The reranker now pins tqdm's class lock to a `threading.RLock`.
- `migrate` failing on DBs upgrading through v0.45.0 with `Field 'heading_level' not found in target schema`. The v0.45.0 picture-data backfill was building rows from the current `DocumentItemRecord` Pydantic model — which now carries `heading_level` / `tree_depth` added in v0.48.0 — and feeding them to `merge_insert` against a pre-v0.48.0 schema. Both v0.40.0 and v0.45.0 now build their PyArrow inputs from explicit per-migration column sets so future model additions can't retroactively break them.

## [0.48.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- `heading_level` and `tree_depth` on `DocumentItem`, populated by `extract_items` and persisted on `document_items`. 0.48.0 migration backfills existing rows from each doc's docling structure blob.
- `toc.json` in the analysis sandbox VFS at `/documents/{id}/toc.json`. Nested tree on HTML/markdown sources, flat sibling list on PDFs. Each node carries `{self_ref, level, title, page_numbers, item_range, chunk_ids, children}`. `chunk_ids` aggregates the citable chunks across the section's `item_range`, so the analysis skill can `cite()` a section from one VFS read instead of falling back to a corpus-wide `search()` that risks cross-document hits.
- `chunk_ids` on every `items.jsonl` row (the citable chunks that contain that item).
- `picture_refs` on sandbox `search()` result dicts and on `Citation` (subset of `doc_item_refs` starting with `#/pictures/`).
- `picture_captions: dict[str, str]` on `SearchResult`, populated alongside `image_data` and rendered as a labelled line in `format_for_agent` for picture-bearing chunks.
- Chat TUI renders picture citations inline via `textual_image.widget.Image` inside the existing `CitationWidget`.
- CLI citation panel renders `picture_refs` inline via `textual_image.renderable.Image` next to the text preview. `format_citations_rich` is async and takes an optional `HaikuRAG` client; without one, figures fall back to `[Figure: <ref>]` markers.
- BTree scalar indexes on `document_items.{document_id, position, self_ref}`. The 0.48.0 migration creates them on existing DBs. Per-doc lookups go from full-table scans (~100–300 ms) to point queries (~3–21 ms) on small/medium corpora.
- Per-doc lazy cache for `items.jsonl` and `toc.json` in the analysis sandbox. First read fetches; subsequent reads of either file in the same `execute_code` session hit a serialized cache. One DB fetch per doc per session.
- `cite` tool now accepts chunk_ids that resolve via the chunks table, not only chunk_ids from a prior `search()` result. Lets the model cite directly from `items.jsonl` / `toc.json` rows. The hallucination guard (`ModelRetry` on chunk_ids that don't exist in the DB) is preserved.
- `AppConfig.evaluations` (`EvaluationsConfig`) with an optional `judge: ModelConfig`. Lets the eval CLI pin the LLM-as-judge per-yaml — including a custom `base_url` for any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (vLLM, LM Studio) without env-var routing.

### Removed

- **Multi-agent research workflow.** Removes `agents/research/` (graph, state, deps, models, prompts), `client.research`, the CLI `research` command, the MCP `research_question` tool, `ResearchConfig`, `AppConfig.research`, `PromptsConfig.synthesis`, and the corresponding wiring in `chat/__init__.py` and `client/downloads.py`. The pydantic-graph workflow was a three-node loop whose differentiators vs the rag skill (planner step, structured `ResearchReport`, iteration bound) were either redundant with `qa.max_searches` or sat on pre-cite-tool legacy. Multi-step questions go through `client.ask` (rag skill).
- `llm()` from the analysis sandbox. Sandbox externals are now `search` and `list_documents` only.
- `list_documents` top-level tool from the analysis skill (still available as `await list_documents()` inside `execute_code`).
- `documents=` kwarg on `client.analyze` (and the `--document` flag on `haiku-rag analyze` / MCP `analyze` tool). The pre-loaded `documents` Python variable inside the sandbox is no longer populated. Use `filter=` (SQL WHERE clause) to scope analysis to specific documents.
- `AnalysisResult.program`. The per-execution programs are still tracked on `AnalysisState.executions` (the analysis skill's `execute_code` tool populates it); consumers that need the executed code should pull it from the skill state instead of the function return value.
- `--cite` flag on `haiku-rag ask`. Citations always render after the answer now.
- `system_prompt` kwarg on `client.ask`. No production caller used it; `config.prompts.domain_preamble` already covers the preamble use case.
- Standalone QA agent (`haiku.rag.agents.qa.*`) and analysis agent module (`haiku.rag.agents.analysis.agent`, `haiku.rag.agents.analysis.prompts`). Also drops `RawAnalysisResult`, `CodeExecution`, `AnalysisDeps`, and the dead `documents=` preload path in `Sandbox`.
- `prompts.qa` config field.
- `evaluations optimize` subcommand and GEPA prompt-optimization. Drops `gepa` dep.
- `--target qa` from `evaluations run`. Default is now `rag-skill`.
- `--judge-model` flag from `evaluations run`. Set the judge in `config.evaluations.judge` instead.
- `position` field on `toc.json` nodes (redundant with `item_range[0]`).
- `position` and `tree_depth` from `items.jsonl` row serialization. Both fields are still persisted on `DocumentItem`; they are no longer surfaced to the sandbox.

### Changed

- `haiku.rag.agents.analysis` moved to `haiku.rag.sandbox`. Public surface: `from haiku.rag.sandbox import Sandbox, SandboxResult, AnalysisContext, AnalysisResult`.
- `Citation` and `resolve_citations` moved to `haiku.rag.store.models.citation` (was `haiku.rag.agents.research.models`), peer to the other output domain models.
- `search.limit` default lowered from `10` to `5`.
- Search result formatter surfaces picture captions on a labelled line when a chunk's expanded refs include pictures.
- Picture bytes attached to `search()` results are bounded to the pre-expansion chunk's `doc_item_refs`. Section expansion that sweeps in adjacent picture-bearing items no longer pulls their bytes into the response. Observed ~16× reduction on tool-response payload sizes; eliminates a class of cross-figure contamination in the agent's view.
- rag-analysis SKILL.md steers structural lookups ("which section X", "list sections of Y", "summarize section Z") to read `/documents/{id}/toc.json` first and cite the matching node's `chunk_ids` directly, instead of calling `search()`. Empirically validated on the ORB multimodal and Wix corpora: locator and orientation questions now cite the correct document instead of falling back to cross-document search hits.
- CLI citation panel compacted: 300-char text preview (no full chunk dump), `[N] Title (URI) — pp. — §Section` header, dimmed `doc: <id>  chunk: <id>` footer. Green "Citations" label matches the green "Answer:" label.
- `AnalysisConfig.model` defaults to `None` (was `ollama:gpt-oss/no-thinking/temp=0`). Resolves via `config.analysis.model or config.qa.model`.
- `client.ask` and `client.analyze` route through the rag and rag-analysis skills internally.
- Bump `docling>=2.93.0` and `docling-core>=2.75.0`.
- Bump `pydantic-ai-slim>=1.96.0`. Migrate off deprecated APIs: AG-UI imports use `pydantic_ai.ui.ag_ui`, docs/CLI examples use the explicit `openai-chat:` model prefix, and `Agent(retries=)` is split into `tool_retries=` + `output_retries=`.
- Bump `pydantic-monty>=0.0.17`. Migrate off deprecated `pydantic_monty.run_repl_async(repl, ...)` to `repl.feed_run_async(...)`.
- Cap `transformers<5.0.0` in the `mxbai` extra: `mxbai-rerank>=0.1.6` calls `tokenizer.prepare_for_model` which transformers 5 removed.
- Refresh the rest of the lockfile to latest within current constraints (pydantic, pydantic-ai, rich, ruff, ty, pytest, torch, textual, textual-image, watchfiles, pre-commit, datasets, and transitives).

### Fixed

- Chat TUI's state-edit screen syntax-highlights JSON instead of falling back to plain text. Adds `tree-sitter` + `tree-sitter-json` to the `[tui]` extra.

### Documentation

- Rework documentation

## [0.47.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added

- **`cross-encoder` reranking provider.** Runs any HuggingFace cross-encoder reranker in-process via `sentence_transformers.CrossEncoder` — no separate server. Useful for BGE (`BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3`), Qwen3-Reranker, MS-MARCO MiniLM, and other CrossEncoder-compatible models when vLLM is not an option. New `[cross-encoder]` extra pulls `sentence-transformers`.

### Fixed

- **`rebuild --embed-only` no longer buffers the entire corpus in memory.** The previous implementation accumulated every chunk's id, content, content_fts, metadata, and new embedding vector in a single Python list before flushing. The rebuild now stream-copies non-vector columns into a `chunks_rebuild_staging` table (1000 rows / page), recreates the chunks table fresh to honour vector-dim changes, then streams from staging one document at a time, embedding in batches of `embeddings.batch_size` and flushing to the new chunks table every 50 documents.
- **`rebuild --embed-only` is now idempotent across crashes.** A second table, `chunks_rebuild_marker`, is written immediately after phase 1 (staging copy) finishes. Its presence flips the next rebuild into resume mode: phase 1 is skipped, the live chunks table is recreated, and phase 2 (re-embed) runs from the existing staging snapshot. Cleanup drops the marker before the staging table, so an interruption between the two drops leaves a markerless staging that the next run discards harmlessly. A staging table without a marker is treated as a partial phase 1 and dropped (the live chunks table is still authoritative). Running a non-embed-only mode (FULL / RECHUNK / DESCRIPTIONS / TITLE_ONLY) after a crashed embed-only correctly discards the staging recovery state. Phase 1's pagination was switched from `offset/limit` to `to_batches`, removing the latent offset-drift risk and the O(N²) cost at high offsets.

## [0.46.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added

- **`processing.conversion_options.fetch_remote_images`** (default `true`). Controls whether docling fetches images referenced by URL in HTML and Markdown inputs. docling-local only — docling-serve cannot fetch external images via its API regardless of this flag.
- **`s3://` is a first-class document source.** `create_document_from_source`, the CLI `haiku-rag add-src`, and the MCP `add_document_from_url` tool all dispatch on the `s3` URL scheme. Two-stage change detection keeps `metadata["md5"]` semantically uniform across all sources: HEAD ETag matching the stored `metadata["etag"]` short-circuits without GET; if ETag differs but bytes hash to the same MD5 (multipart re-upload, server-side `CopyObject`, SSE mode change), only the etag refreshes — no re-chunk or re-embed. Closes #357.
- **S3 / object-storage monitoring.** `monitor.s3: list[S3MonitorEntry]` adds a polling watcher per bucket prefix alongside the existing local-directory watcher. Each entry has its own `poll_interval`, `include_patterns`, `ignore_patterns`, `delete_orphans`, and `storage_options`. The same `serve --monitor` flag enables both. Orphan deletion is per-entry (scoped via `uri LIKE 's3://bucket/prefix/%'`); other buckets and prefixes are never touched.
- **`[s3]` optional extra** (`obstore>=0.9`). Required for `s3://` sources and the S3 watcher. Uses obstore — the Python binding to the same Rust `object_store` crate that LanceDB uses internally — so `monitor.s3[*].storage_options` accepts the same dict shape as `lancedb.storage_options`. Empty/missing options fall back to the AWS default credential chain.
- **`scripts/run-integration-tests.sh`** — wraps `docker compose up --wait`, `pytest -m integration`, and tear-down so the SeaweedFS-backed integration suite is a one-liner.
- **`ModelConfig.extra_body`**. Optional dict forwarded verbatim to `ModelSettings.extra_body`, the raw pass-through pydantic-ai exposes for openai/ollama/anthropic/groq. Lets configs reach provider-specific keys without haiku.rag modelling them — e.g. `extra_body: {chat_template_kwargs: {enable_thinking: false}}` to disable Qwen3 thinking on a vLLM endpoint, where the high-level `enable_thinking` flag is a no-op.
- **`embeddings.batch_size`** (default `512`). Number of text chunks per `/v1/embeddings` call during ingest. Lower it when your provider caps total tokens per request. Closes #365.

### Changed

- **Chat TUI streams markdown incrementally.** Assistant messages now use Textual's `MarkdownStream` (`Markdown.get_stream`) and write per-token deltas instead of re-parsing the entire accumulated message on every token. Removes the O(n²) re-parse that visibly stuttered long responses. Bumps `textual` floor to `>=8.2.4` so `Markdown.get_stream` is reachable via the public API.
- **Embedding compatibility check only raises on `vector_dim` mismatch.** `provider` and `name` drift (legitimate when the same model is served by a different stack, e.g. Ollama → vLLM-via-openai) now logs a one-time warning and updates the stored settings to match the current config. Subsequent opens are silent. Run `rebuild --embed-only` if you also want to re-embed under the new stack.
- **`processing.pictures` enum replaces `picture_description.enabled`.** Three modes: `none` (skip picture generation entirely — lower RAM, smaller DBs), `description` (generate images, run VLM, store bytes), `image` (default — generate images, store bytes, no VLM). Closes #366. Breaking change: rename `picture_description.enabled: true` → `pictures: description`, `picture_description.enabled: false` → `pictures: image`. The pre-April-30 `generate_picture_images` flag is also gone; use `pictures: none` for that opt-out.

### Fixed

- **Picture bytes attached to multimodal tool returns are PNG-verified via `PIL.Image.verify()`.** Bytes that fail verification are dropped.
- **Conversion options now apply to non-PDF formats.** `DoclingLocalConverter` previously wired its `PdfPipelineOptions` only to `InputFormat.PDF`, so user settings (OCR knobs, `picture_description.enabled`, `images_scale`, etc.) silently no-op'd for HTML, Markdown, DOCX, PPTX, and IMAGE inputs. The converter now shares a single `PdfPipelineOptions` instance across PDF, IMAGE, HTML, MD, DOCX, and PPTX `FormatOption`s. SimplePipeline-backed formats ignore the PDF-specific fields; `ConvertPipelineOptions`-level enrichments (picture description / classification / chart extraction) now run uniformly. HTML and Markdown additionally receive `HTMLBackendOptions` / `MarkdownBackendOptions` gated on `fetch_remote_images`.
- **HTML text ingest path picks up converter options.** `convert_text(format="html"/"md")` previously used a bare `DoclingDocConverter()` with zero format options — the wix corpus ingest path. It now uses the same shared `_build_format_options()` helper as the file path.
- **Relative `<img>` paths resolve during URL ingest.** `HaikuRAG.convert()` and the converter `convert_file` / `convert_text` methods now thread a `source_uri` through to `HTMLBackendOptions.source_uri` / `MarkdownBackendOptions.source_uri`. URL ingest uses the originating URL; file ingest uses `file://`; raw text accepts an optional override. docling-serve accepts the kwarg as a no-op (its API has no equivalent option).
- **CLI tracebacks no longer dump per-frame locals.** The Typer app now passes `pretty_exceptions_show_locals=False`, so exceptions involving a `DoclingDocument` (or any large object) print readable rich tracebacks instead of pages of inline base64 image URIs. Set `_TYPER_STANDARD_TRACEBACK=1` for plain Python tracebacks.
- **Batch ingest no longer hits HF Hub's 429 rate limit.** The chunking tokenizer is now loaded once per process via `@functools.cache` instead of once per chunker instance.

### Documentation

- New "External image fetching" subsection in `docs/configuration/processing.md` documenting `fetch_remote_images`, the SSRF / size / timeout guards inherited from docling, and a per-format table of which conversion options actually apply (PDF, IMAGE, HTML, MD, DOCX/PPTX, others).
- New "HTML Image Fetching" section in `docs/remote-processing.md` calling out that docling-serve cannot fetch external `<img>` URLs and recommending docling-local for HTML ingest when picture bytes matter.
- New "S3 / Object Storage Monitoring" section in `docs/server.md` and `docs/configuration/processing.md` covering the `[s3]` extra, polling cadence, ETag semantics, credentials, and CLI usage.
- New "Deployment Pattern: One Writer, Many Readers" subsection in `docs/configuration/storage.md` documenting the recommended IAM split (one ingestion process + N read-only consumers).

## [0.45.0] - 2026-05-08

### Added

- **Vision capabilities.** Picture-aware ingestion, vision QA, multimodal embeddings, and image-as-query search.
- **Picture bytes always stored** at ingest in a new `document_items.picture_data` column (`large_binary`), addressable by `(document_id, self_ref)`. Bulk read paths project metadata-only so bytes never leak into context expansion or analysis-sandbox builds. The 0.45.0 migration adds the column on existing DBs and backfills it from each doc's docling blob; URIs are then stripped from the blob so bytes live in one place.
- **VLM picture descriptions** at ingest via `processing.conversion_options.picture_description.enabled` (default `false`). When enabled, descriptions are woven into chunk text. The earlier `generate_picture_images` flag is dropped with a one-time warning. `haiku-rag rebuild --descriptions` runs the VLM over stored bytes after the fact, idempotently — skipping the docling parse entirely.
- **Multimodal embedder (`provider="vllm"`)** for cross-modal retrieval. Talks HTTP to a vLLM `/v1/embeddings` endpoint (`input` array for text, `messages` superset with `image_url` for images). Tested with `Qwen/Qwen3-VL-Embedding-8B` and `jinaai/jina-embeddings-v4`. No new Python ML dependencies. Under multimodal embedders, ingest emits one synthetic picture chunk per `PictureItem`, sharing the chunks table with text.
- **Image-as-query search.** `client.search()` accepts `str | bytes | PIL.Image.Image`. Image queries embed once and run vector-only against the chunks table. New CLI flag `haiku-rag search --image PATH` and new MCP tool `search_documents_by_image(image_base64, ...)` (registered only when the embedder supports images).
- **Vision QA via `qa.model.vision: bool` flag** on `ModelConfig` (default `false`). When `true`, the agent's `search` tool attaches picture bytes as `BinaryContent` parts on its `ToolReturn`. Default is `false` because providers behave inconsistently when an image is sent to a text-only model (Ollama silently accepts and confabulates; OpenAI returns 400). `SearchResult.image_data: dict[str, str] | None` carries base64 picture bytes keyed by `self_ref`; `client.search()` and MCP `search_documents` gain `include_images: bool = True`.
- **Silent-failure guard for picture descriptions.** When `picture_description.enabled=true` and a conversion returns at least one picture but zero descriptions, log a warning naming the source, picture count, VLM model, and base URL. Surfaces docling-serve's swallowed VLM errors (unreachable host, missing model) before they pollute a long ingest.
- **Inspector renders attached pictures** under `qa.model.vision=true` in the context modal (`c` key) so the inspector reflects what the LLM actually receives.

### Fixed

- **`rebuild --descriptions` no longer destroys `docling_pages`.** The previous implementation called `set_docling()` after a structure-only docling load, which writes `docling_pages=None` and clobbered page rasters for every doc with at least one undescribed picture (silently breaking `visualize_chunk` for the affected docs).
- **docling-serve picture-image extraction.** docling-serve only emits picture bytes under `image_export_mode="referenced"` (upstream [docling-project/docling-serve#576](https://github.com/docling-project/docling-serve/issues/576)). The converter switches to `referenced` + `target_type="zip"` when picture images are requested and rehydrates `artifacts/<filename>` URIs back into `data:` URIs.
- **`rebuild --rechunk` reuses the stored docling blob** instead of re-converting from the markdown export, which dropped every `PictureItem` on the floor. Documents without a stored docling blob now raise instead of silently falling back.

### Changed

- **Lazy document hydration during rebuild.** Each mode loop now fetches one full record at a time instead of eagerly loading all docs with their multi-MB blobs. Drops startup memory from ~15 GB to ~one document on a 1000-doc database.

## [0.44.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added

- **Skill-based QA evaluation via `evaluations run --target {qa,rag-skill,analysis-skill}`.** Benchmark the RAG and analysis skills end-to-end alongside the existing QA agent path, against the same datasets and judge. `--skill-model "provider:name"` overrides the skill model independently from the judge.
- **Citation retrieval as a second eval metric.** `CitationMRREvaluator` and `CitationMAPEvaluator` score the URIs the skill registered via the `cite` tool against each dataset's gold `expected_uris`, alongside the existing LLMJudge. Console output gains a "Citation Retrieval" summary (mean score, cite rate, mean citations per case). Zero extra skill runs — cited URIs are surfaced via `pydantic_evals.set_eval_attribute`.
- Bumps `haiku.skills` to `>=0.16.0` for the public `run_skill` API and `Skill.request_limit`.

### Changed

- **Pinned eval judge defaults to `ollama:qwen3.6`.** Previously `--judge-model` defaulted to `config.qa.model`, so changing the QA or skill model also changed the judge — destabilizing cross-run comparisons and re-introducing self-judging whenever the answerer matched. A 2×2 calibration vs Claude Opus 4.7 (gpt-oss / qwen3.6 as both answerer and judge) showed `qwen3.6` had κ ≥ 0.66 on both same- and cross-family answerers (vs 0.39–0.55 for `gpt-oss`) with no detectable self-preference bias. Pass `--judge-model provider:name` to override.
- **Tightened `cite` framing in the RAG skill's `SKILL.md`.** `cite` is now a precondition for the final answer: the model identifies supporting chunk IDs and calls `cite` *before* writing the response. The "MUST cite before answering" requirement carries an explicit refusal carve-out so the model does not cite irrelevant chunks when knowledge is missing. On the wix benchmark this lifted cite rate from 32% → 96%, mean `cited_map` from 0.15 → 0.48, and cut the "correct answer with no citation" pattern from 52% of cases to 1%, with QA accuracy holding at ~78%.
- **Removed dataset-specific eval system prompts.** `WIX_SUPPORT_PROMPT` and `ORB_SYSTEM_PROMPT` duplicated guidance already in the shipped `QA_SYSTEM_PROMPT` and `SKILL.md`, and ORB's referenced the obsolete `search_documents` tool name. The eval-side machinery for injecting them (`DatasetSpec.system_prompt`, `resolve_system_prompt()`) is removed. `config.prompts.qa` remains as the user-facing override knob.

## [0.43.1] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed

- **Relative `db_path` no longer trips the LanceDB cloud-URI sanitizer.** The 0.43 migration to `lancedb.connect_async` started routing the path through an async URI sanitizer that treats anything not clearly an absolute local path as a possible cloud URI, raising `ValueError: An api_key is required when connecting to LanceDb Cloud` on invocations like `haiku-rag info --db db/rag.lancedb`. The path is now made absolute before being handed to LanceDB.

## [0.43.0] - 2026-04-24

### Changed

- **Native async LanceDB**: all table I/O now uses LanceDB's async API (`connect_async`, `AsyncConnection`, `AsyncTable`). Previously, repository methods were declared `async def` but called blocking sync LanceDB under the hood, stalling the event loop on every read/write. No change to the documented `async with HaikuRAG(...) as client:` usage pattern.
- **BREAKING (internal): `HaikuRAG` must be used via `async with`.** Store initialization now happens in `__aenter__`; constructing `HaikuRAG(...)` and calling methods directly without entering the context manager no longer works.
- **BREAKING (internal): `download_models` is no longer a method on `HaikuRAG`.** It's now a module-level function: `from haiku.rag.client.downloads import download_models; async for progress in download_models(config): ...`. The CLI and in-repo consumers are updated.
- **Concurrency: background vacuum tracked as a task** on the client. `__aexit__` and `rebuild_database` now await it explicitly, preventing `CreateIndex transaction was preempted` commit conflicts when destructive operations follow a `create_document` that scheduled a background vacuum.

### Fixed

- **Chat TUI now renders citations again.** After the 0.42.1 flattening of skill state `citations` to `list[str]`, the TUI still indexed `citations[-1]` and iterated the resulting chunk-id string character-by-character, so no citations resolved through `citation_index` and the citation panel stayed empty. Fixed by iterating `state.citations` directly.
- **`search(..., filter=...)` no longer silently under-returns.** The filter path used to materialize LanceDB's top-N window, filter to matching `document_id`s in pandas, and `head(limit)`. When matching chunks lived outside that top-N window (selective filters, broad queries), the caller got fewer than `limit` results even though plenty of matching chunks existed in the index. The document filter is now pushed down into the chunk query as `document_id IN (...)` so `.limit(limit)` applies to matching chunks directly. Behavior change: searches that previously under-returned will start returning the requested count.

## [0.42.1] - 2026-04-22

### Changed

- **BREAKING: Skill state `citations` is now `list[str]` instead of `list[list[str]]`.** With per-invocation state scoping (0.42), the outer list no longer tracked turn boundaries — it only grouped chunk ids per `cite` call within a single invocation, which has no downstream meaning. The field is now a flat, deduplicated list of chunk ids cited during the current invocation. Clients resolve each id through `citation_index` as before. Applies to both `RAGState` and `AnalysisState`.

## [0.42.0] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed

- **`create_document`, `update_document`, and rebuild (`RECHUNK` / full fallback) no longer misread URL-prefixed text as a URL to fetch.** These paths passed known-text content through `HaikuRAG.convert()`, which dispatches on `urlparse(source).scheme`; text whose first line was `https://...` (common for clipped web pages and notes) got handed to `httpx.get` and crashed with `httpx.InvalidURL` on embedded whitespace. Fixed by calling `converter.convert_text(...)` directly at those sites; `convert()` itself is unchanged for `create_document_from_source`.

### Changed

- **Skills share a single `HaikuRAG` client per invocation** via the new `haiku.skills>=0.15.0` `lifespan` hook. The skill's sub-agent opens one read-only client on entry, all tool calls reuse it, and it closes on exit — replacing the old pattern of open/close around every `search` / `list_documents` / `get_document` call.
- **`max_searches` tracked on `RAGRunDeps.search_count`** instead of a module-level `ctx.run_id`-keyed dict. Eliminates a memory leak in long-running processes where old run ids were never evicted.
- **Analysis sandbox persists variables across `execute_code` calls within one invocation.** Re-enables the incremental-exploration workflow (search in one call, process results in the next). Each new skill invocation constructs a fresh `Sandbox` via the analysis lifespan, so there is no cross-invocation leak.
- **Skill state is scoped to the current invocation.** Lifespans now clear `citations`, `searches`, and (for analysis) `executions` at the start of each invocation, so state deltas sent to the AG-UI client reflect only the in-progress turn. `citation_index` is preserved across invocations so past-turn citation chunk ids remain resolvable, and `document_filter` is preserved as session-level config.

## [0.41.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- **Document virtual filesystem in analysis sandbox**: Documents mounted at `/documents/{id}/` with `metadata.json` (eager), `content.txt` (lazy), and `items.jsonl` (lazy). Standard Python `pathlib.Path` for browsing and reading document content and structure.
- **`execute_code` skill tool**: Direct code execution in the sandbox, surfaced as individual AG-UI events in the chat TUI. Items VFS uses a lazy bulk cache (~1s for 1000 documents vs 60s+ per-document queries).
- **`cite` skill tool**: Explicit citation registration with per-turn tracking via `citation_index` and `citations` fields in state
- **`--skill` flag for chat TUI**: `haiku-rag chat -s rag -s analysis` to enable specific skills
- **`--model` overrides all agents**: Chat, QA, research, and analysis agents all use the specified model
- **Collapsible program display in chat TUI**: Analysis code execution results shown as expandable code blocks

### Changed

- **BREAKING: Flatten skill architecture**: Skill sub-agents now call `search`, `execute_code`, `cite`, `list_documents`, `get_document` directly — every tool call surfaces as an AG-UI event. Removes the 3rd agent layer where `ask`/`analyze`/`research` spawned inner agents whose tool calls were invisible.
- **BREAKING: Rename RLM agent to analysis agent** throughout:
  - `agents/rlm/` → `agents/analysis/`, all classes renamed (`RLMResult` → `AnalysisResult`, etc.)
  - `client.rlm()` → `client.analyze()`
  - CLI: `haiku-rag rlm` → `haiku-rag analyze`
  - MCP: `rlm_question` → `analyze`
  - Config: `rlm:` → `analysis:` in YAML, `RLMConfig` → `AnalysisConfig`
  - Skill entrypoint: `rag-rlm` → `rag-analysis`
- **Analysis sandbox `search()` returns expanded results** with `doc_item_refs` and `labels` for cross-referencing with `items.jsonl`
- **`list_documents` skill tool** takes no parameters — returns all documents
- **Per-turn citation tracking**: `citation_index: dict[str, Citation]` (deduplicated) + `citations: list[list[str]]` (per-turn chunk IDs) replaces flat citation list
- **Search rate limiting**: Skill search tool enforces `config.qa.max_searches`
- **Context expansion respects section boundaries**: Sections within the char budget are returned whole regardless of item count. Too-large sections expand bounded by section edges. Adjacent sections no longer merge — only overlapping ranges do.
- **Visualization shows full expanded section**: `visualize_chunk` expands context before resolving bounding boxes, so all pages the section spans get highlighted.

### Removed

- **`ask` skill tool**: Replaced by direct `search` + `cite` — the skill sub-agent searches and answers directly
- **`analyze` skill tool**: Replaced by direct `execute_code` + `search` + `cite`
- **`research` skill tool**: Removed from skill layer (still available via CLI `haiku-rag research` and MCP)
- **`get_document()`, `get_docling_document()`**: Removed from analysis sandbox — replaced by VFS
- **`get_chunk()`**: Removed from analysis sandbox — search results include expanded context
- **`create_analysis_toolset()`**: Removed unused `tools/analysis.py` module
- **`qa_history`, `reports` from skill state**: Conversational context handled by the outer chat agent
- **`combine_filters`, `build_document_filter`**: Removed from public API
- **`max_context_items`**: Removed from `SearchConfig` — `max_context_chars` is the sole expansion constraint
- **`QAHistoryEntry`, `tools/qa.py`**: Removed unused QA history model and relevance threshold

## [0.40.1] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- **`haiku-rag info` on pre-migration databases**: `info` no longer fails with a misleading `Cannot create tables in read-only mode` error when a required table added by a later version (e.g. `document_items` in 0.40.0) is absent. It now reports stats for the tables that do exist, marks the missing ones as `absent`, and shows a dedicated section listing any pending migrations with the `haiku-rag migrate` hint ([#346](https://github.com/ggozad/haiku.rag/issues/346))

## [0.39.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- **Document items table**: Pre-extracted document items stored as individual rows with scalar indexes, enabling context expansion via indexed range queries (~2.5ms) instead of full DoclingDocument deserialization (~8.7s for large documents)
- **Section-bounded context expansion**: Expansion is now automatic and structure-aware — stays within section boundaries for structured documents, grows outward for unstructured ones. Noise labels (footnotes, page headers/footers) are filtered. Results without `doc_item_refs` pass through unexpanded.

### Changed

- **Database migration required**: Run `haiku-rag migrate` to populate `document_items` table for existing documents
- **Pin docling-core**: Upper bound added (`<2.72`) to prevent uncontrolled schema changes
- **`max_searches` default**: Raised from 3 to 5 — faster expansion makes additional searches inexpensive
- **Improved QA prompt**: Stronger instruction to refuse answering from tangentially related content
- **Improved judge prompt**: Asymmetric evaluation — generated answers that are more comprehensive than expected are not penalized

### Removed

- **`context_radius` config**: Replaced by automatic section-bounded expansion. Context expansion no longer requires configuration.
- **DoclingDocument LRU cache**: No longer needed — the document_items table replaces in-memory caching for context expansion
- **`cachetools` dependency**: No longer used

## [0.39.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added

- **S3/Object storage support**: Connect to LanceDB on S3, GCS, Azure Blob, or HDFS via `lancedb.uri` and `storage_options` config. Supports S3-compatible stores with custom endpoints.
- **Remote skill generation**: `create-skill` now supports remote databases — omit `--db` and provide `--config-file` to generate skills that connect to object storage at runtime instead of bundling the database.

### Fixed

- **Skill `list_documents` ignores `document_filter`**: `list_documents` tool now respects `state.document_filter`, consistent with `search`, `ask`, and `research`
- **Skill `analyze` ignores `document_filter`**: `analyze` tool now uses `state.document_filter` (combined with any explicit `filter` parameter). Added `document_filter` field to `RLMState`

## [0.38.0] - 2026-04-07

### Added

- **Separate page storage**: Page images stored in dedicated `docling_pages` column — search/expand never loads page data
- **zstd compression**: Switch from gzip to zstd for docling document storage (Python 3.14 stdlib, zstandard package for older versions)
- **`Document.set_docling()`**: Helper method that handles split compression and version assignment, replacing 11 manual call sites
- **`Document.get_page_images()`**: Load page images without the document structure, for visualize_chunk
- **`DocumentRepository.get_pages_data()`**: Load only page data column for a document

### Changed

- **Database migration required**: Run `haiku-rag migrate` to split existing docling blobs into structure + pages and re-compress with zstd

### Fixed

- **Generated skill `domain_preamble`**: Apply `config.prompts.domain_preamble` to instructions in generated skill packages

## [0.37.0] - 2026-04-07

### Changed

- **Dependency updates**: lancedb 0.30.2, pydantic-ai-slim ≥1.77.0, docling ≥2.84.0, docling-core ≥2.71.0, haiku.skills ≥0.13.0, cachetools ≥7.0.5, pydantic-monty ≥0.0.9, cohere ≥5.21.1, textual ≥8.2.1, ty ≥0.0.28, ruff ≥0.15.9
- **Search result model**: `SearchResult` now includes `order` field propagated from chunk order

### Fixed

- **Type checking**: Fix 37 new ty 0.0.28 diagnostics with proper None guards, assertions, and specific ignore codes
- **Search performance**: Avoid loading full document blobs (docling_document, content) during search — use column projection to fetch only needed metadata (id, uri, title, metadata)
- **Context expansion performance**: Load only docling columns during expand_context (skip content blob), and only when doc_item_refs exist
- **Chunk expansion performance**: Fetch only chunks in the needed order range during context expansion instead of all chunks for a document
- **Embedding batching**: Batch embedding calls in groups of 512 to avoid request size limits and timeouts with large documents
- **DoclingDocument validation**: Strip page images before validation on the read path — pages are only needed for visualize_chunk and account for ~99% of the JSON size

## [0.36.3] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed

- **Citation formatting**: Replace raw UUIDs (`[doc_id:chunk_id]`) with human-readable identifiers (`[index] title`) in `format_citations()` output, preventing LLMs from hallucinating opaque ID markers in answers
- **domain_preamble propagation**: `domain_preamble` now flows to skill subagents and the main agent preamble, not just internal agents (QA, research). Fixes ambiguous queries failing when domain context was needed.

### Changed

- **domain_preamble docs**: Clarified that `domain_preamble` is for domain context (subject matter, terminology), not behavioral instructions (tone, response style).

## [0.36.2] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed

- **Skill extras**: Include `db_path` and `config` in skill extras for both RAG and RLM skills, enabling post-creation reconfiguration

## [0.36.1] - 2026-03-27

## [0.36.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added

- **Chunk visualization for generated skills**: `visualize_chunk(chunk_id)` function exposed in generated skill packages, enabling callers to render visual grounding from chunk IDs in skill state
- **Configurable generated skills**: Generated skill `create_skill()` now accepts optional `db_path` and `config` parameters, enabling post-discovery reconfiguration via `skill.reconfigure()` (requires haiku.skills >= 0.11.0)

### Fixed

- **Generated skill packages**: Include SKILL.md and assets in wheel distributions. Add README to generated packages.
- **Docling-serve chunker**: Detect per-document failure status that was silently returning 0 chunks when the task-level status was "success" but individual documents failed
- **Docling local chunker**: Re-enable `repeat_table_header` for self-contained table chunks, improving retrieval quality and matching docling-serve behavior

## [0.35.1] - 2026-03-24

### Added

- **`create-skill` CLI command**: Generate standalone skill packages with embedded LanceDB databases. Generated packages register as `haiku.skills` entry points.

## [0.35.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added

- **Configurable judge and reflect models**: `evaluations run` and `evaluations optimize` accept `--judge-model provider:name`; `optimize` also accepts `--reflect-model provider:name`. Both fall back to `config.qa.model` when not specified.
- **`parse_model_option`**: Utility in `haiku.rag.utils` for parsing `provider:name` strings into `ModelConfig`
- **New format extensions**: `.tex`, `.latex`, `.qmd` (Quarto), `.rmd` (R Markdown) supported in both local and serve converters

### Changed

- **LLMJudge**: Custom evaluator now accepts `ModelConfig` instead of a model name string
- **Docling upgrade**: docling-core ≥2.70.2 (schema 1.10.0), docling ≥2.81.0. Adds field data model support for structured form/KV content, wide table chunking fixes, and rich table cell hang fix
- **pydantic-ai ≥1.70.0**: Bumped minimum version. Removed `structured_output_type` helper — all supported providers now handle native structured output, so agents pass result types directly

## [0.34.1] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- **PlantUML support**: `.puml`, `.plantuml`, and `.pu` files are now indexed as `plantuml` code blocks

## [0.34.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- **Activity events**: TUI and web frontend now display skill sub-agent tool calls via `ActivitySnapshotEvent`

### Changed

- **RLM sandbox**: Bumped pydantic-monty to 0.0.8. Removed `regex_*` external functions — the sandbox now has native `re` and `math` modules via `import`. Also adds `filter()` and `getattr()` builtins.
- **Frontend deps**: Upgraded CopilotKit to 1.54.0 and @ag-ui/client to 0.0.47

## [0.33.3] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **GEPA prompt optimization**: `evaluations optimize` command for automated QA system prompt improvement using evolutionary optimization with LLM-judged scoring. Cases are split 50/50 into train/val sets; GEPA budget is auto-computed from `--num-candidates` and dataset size.
- **Tuning docs**: Added step 7 (Optimize QA Prompts) to the tuning workflow in `docs/tuning.md`
- **Evaluations test coverage**: Tests for evaluators (MAP, MRR), config, benchmark helpers, dataset mappers/builders, and optimization

### Fixed

- **Read-only mode table creation**: `--read-only` no longer creates lance tables when pointed at an empty directory. `Store._init_tables()` now raises `ReadOnlyError` when tables are missing in read-only mode.

## [0.33.2] - 2026-03-11

### Changed

- **QA search cap**: Replace dead `max_iterations`/`max_concurrency` config with `max_searches` (default: 3). The QA agent now enforces a per-run search limit, reducing average response time from ~30s to ~15s while maintaining accuracy. The limit resets per agent run so toolsets can be safely reused.
- **Default search limit**: Increased from 5 to 10 results per search query for better coverage.

### Fixed

- **QA citations**: Strengthened prompt to clarify chunk ID format (complete IDs without brackets). `resolve_citations` now strips `[]` from IDs, handling models that copy brackets from search result formatting.

## [0.33.1] - 2026-03-06

### Changed

- **Default model temperatures**: Set task-appropriate temperature defaults — 0.3 for QA, research, and title generation; 0.0 for RLM and picture description. Previously unset (provider defaults, typically 0.7–1.0).
- **QA thinking enabled by default**: `enable_thinking` now defaults to `True` for QA agent, improving answer quality with reasoning models.
- **Default title max_tokens**: Set `max_tokens=100` for title generation model to keep titles concise
- **Evaluation judge**: Set `temperature=0.0` and `enable_thinking=True` for deterministic, higher-quality judging. Removed unused judge config from retrieval benchmarks.
- **Test suite cleanup**: Removed stale VCR cassettes, dead fixtures, orphaned directories, and redundant tests. Strengthened weak assertions across search, context enhancement, and converter tests. Relocated misplaced `SearchResult._get_primary_label` test to `test_search.py`
- **Parallel test execution**: Added `pytest-xdist` and enabled parallel test runs by default (`-n auto`), reducing test suite time from ~3.5 min to ~2 min

## [0.33.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- **Module-level skill introspection API**: `STATE_TYPE`, `STATE_NAMESPACE`, `skill_metadata()`, `instructions()`, and `state_metadata()` on `haiku.rag.skills.rag` and `haiku.rag.skills.rlm` — allows introspecting skill configuration without calling `create_skill()`
- **Automatic structured output detection**: Native JSON schema output is used automatically when the model supports it, with tool-call fallback otherwise. No configuration needed.

### Changed

- **`haiku.skills` dependency**: Bumped to `>=0.7.0` for `StateMetadata` dataclass

## [0.32.3] - 2026-03-03

### Changed

- **AG-UI skill streaming**: Tool calls within skills are now streamed as real-time AG-UI events to the frontend. Requires `haiku.skills>=0.6.0`

### Fixed

- **Search tool regression**: Removed LLM-facing `filter` parameter from search and list_documents tools. The SQL WHERE clause description confused LLMs, degrading QA accuracy. Document filtering is now handled programmatically via `base_filter` and `state.document_filter`

## [0.32.2] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- **Compatibility with haiku.skills 0.5.1**: Replaced removed `SkillToolset.system_prompt` with `build_system_prompt(toolset.skill_catalog)` across chat TUI, backend app, and examples
- **Minimum dependency**: Bumped `haiku.skills` requirement to `>=0.5.1`
- **Chat model default**: Chat TUI and backend app now use the configured QA model instead of hardcoded `openai:gpt-4o`

## [0.32.1] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- **Automatic title generation**: Documents can now have titles auto-generated during ingestion via `processing.auto_title: true`. Uses two-tier extraction: structural metadata from DoclingDocument (HTML `<title>`, h1, section headers) first, with LLM fallback via configurable `processing.title_model`
- **`generate_title()`**: Public method on `HaikuRAG` to generate a title for an existing document on demand
- **`rebuild --title-only`**: New rebuild mode that generates titles only for untitled documents without re-chunking or re-embedding
- **`add --title`**: CLI option to set a title when adding text documents

## [0.32.0] - 2026-02-24

### Changed

- **RLM sandbox**: Replaced Docker-based code execution with [pydantic-monty](https://github.com/pydantic/monty), a minimal secure Python interpreter written in Rust. Eliminates Docker as a runtime dependency for RLM with sub-millisecond sandbox startup
- **RLM sandbox functions**: Added `get_chunk(chunk_id)` for retrieving chunk content and metadata from search results. `get_docling_document(document_id)` now returns the full document structure as a JSON dict. All sandbox functions now require `await`
- **`RLMConfig`**: Removed `docker_image` and `docker_memory_limit` fields

### Added

- **RLM sandbox regex functions**: `regex_findall`, `regex_sub`, `regex_search`, `regex_split` for pattern matching without LLM calls
- **`HaikuRAG.get_chunk_by_id()`**: Public method for chunk lookup by ID

### Removed

- **`docker_sandbox.py`**, **`runner.py`**: Docker container plumbing replaced by `sandbox.py`

## [0.31.1] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed

- **`info` and `history` commands**: Open database in read-only mode to prevent write failures on read-only filesystems

## [0.31.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- **RAG skill** (`haiku.rag.skills.rag`): haiku.skills integration with search, list_documents, get_document, ask, and research tools plus managed `RAGState`
- **RLM skill** (`haiku.rag.skills.rlm`): haiku.skills integration with analyze tool for computational analysis via code execution
- **`HaikuRAG.research()`**: Client method for multi-agent research
- **haiku.skills entry points**: `rag = "haiku.rag.skills.rag:create_skill"`, `rag-rlm = "haiku.rag.skills.rlm:create_skill"`

### Changed

- **Chat TUI**: Rebuilt on RAG skill + haiku.skills `SkillToolset`
- **Web app backend**: Rebuilt on RAG skill + `AGUIAdapter`
- **Toolsets simplified**: Removed `ToolContext`, `SessionState`, `AgentDeps`, `Toolkit`; kept core `FunctionToolset` factories
- **Research graph**: Removed `session_context` and conversational output mode

### Removed

- **`agents/chat/`**: Entire chat agent module (replaced by RAG skill)
- **`--deep` flag**: Removed from `ask` CLI (use `research` command instead)
- **`--context`/`--context-file`**: Removed from `ask` CLI
- **`tools/` state machinery**: `ToolContext`, `ToolContextCache`, `SessionState`, `AgentDeps`, `Toolkit`, etc.

## [0.30.2] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed

- Added `cachetools` as an explicit dependency (was only available transitively, causing `ModuleNotFoundError` for some installations)
- **download-models**: Show actionable error message when Ollama is not running instead of cryptic "All connection attempts failed" (#277)

## [0.30.1] - 2026-02-17

### Changed

- **AG-UI state sync**: `ask` tool now emits `StateDeltaEvent` (JSON Patch) instead of `StateSnapshotEvent`, consistent with the `search` tool

## [0.30.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- **Composable toolsets**: New `haiku.rag.tools` module with reusable `FunctionToolset` factories that can be mixed into any pydantic-ai agent
  - `create_search_toolset()` — hybrid search with context expansion and citation tracking
  - `create_document_toolset()` — document listing, retrieval, and summarization
  - `create_qa_toolset()` — question answering via research graph with prior answer recall
  - `create_analysis_toolset()` — computational analysis via RLM agent (Docker sandbox)
- **`Toolkit` and `build_toolkit()`**: High-level factory that bundles toolsets, prompt, and context creation for a given feature set. Reduces agent composition from ~15 lines to ~5. `build_chat_toolkit()` adds chat-specific defaults (background summarization callback)
- **`ToolContext`**: Namespace-based state container shared across toolsets. Toolsets register Pydantic models under string namespaces, enabling state accumulation (search results, citations, QA history) across invocations
- **`ToolContextCache`**: In-memory TTL-based cache for `ToolContext` instances, keyed by external session/thread ID. Replaces module-level caches for embeddings and summaries
- **`run_qa_core()`**: Extracted core QA function for direct programmatic use without an agent
- **Feature-based chat agent**: `create_chat_agent()` accepts a `features` list to select which toolsets are enabled (`search`, `documents`, `qa`, `analysis`). System prompt is composed to match
- **New documentation**: `docs/tools.md` covers all toolsets, `ToolContext`, state management, filter helpers, and composing custom agents

### Changed

- **Toolset factories decoupled from runtime dependencies**: `create_search_toolset()`, `create_qa_toolset()`, `create_document_toolset()`, `create_analysis_toolset()`, and `create_chat_agent()` no longer take `client` or `context` parameters. Instead, tool functions receive these via pydantic-ai's `RunContext.deps`. This enables toolset and agent creation at configuration time (cacheable, created once), with only lightweight deps created per-request. Deps must satisfy the `RAGDeps` protocol (`client: HaikuRAG`, `tool_context: ToolContext | None`)
- **Toolset factory return types narrowed to `FunctionToolset[RAGDeps]`**: All four toolset factories now declare their return type as `FunctionToolset[RAGDeps]` instead of bare `FunctionToolset`
- **`create_chat_agent()` accepts optional `toolkit` parameter**: Pass a pre-built `Toolkit` to share toolsets between agent and context creation, avoiding duplicate construction
- **`ChatDeps` now includes `client`**: `ChatDeps(config=..., client=..., tool_context=...)` — the `client` field was added since it's no longer captured by the agent factory
- **`prepare_chat_context()` helper**: Extracted from `create_chat_agent()` for idempotent namespace registration, since the agent factory no longer has access to the context
- **Chat agent architecture**: Rebuilt on composable toolsets instead of monolithic tool definitions. Chat agent is now a thin wrapper around `create_search_toolset`, `create_document_toolset`, `create_qa_toolset`, and `create_analysis_toolset`
- **State management simplified**: Removed `session_id`, `incoming_session_id`, and `incoming_session_context` from the state layer. `ToolContextCache` preserves all state (embeddings, summaries, QA history) on cached `ToolContext` instances, eliminating the need for module-level caches
- **AG-UI state sync**: `ask` tool now emits `StateSnapshotEvent` instead of `StateDeltaEvent`, ensuring background summarization results are reliably delivered to clients
- **TUI simplified**: Chat TUI reads directly from `ToolContext` namespace states instead of maintaining a separate `ChatSessionState` and manually syncing via AG-UI state events
- **AG-UI web app**: Uses `ToolContextCache` to maintain per-thread state across requests
- **Frontend session management**: Persistent chat sessions with localStorage, wired to backend `ToolContextCache` via CopilotKit `threadId`
  - Session manager dropdown: create, switch, delete, and export sessions to markdown
  - Messages, chat state, and citations restored on session switch
  - Session title derived from first user message
  - Inline citation blocks injected after assistant responses via `qa_history` correlation

### Removed

- **`SearchAgent`**: Replaced by `create_search_toolset()`
- **Module-level session caches**: `_session_cache`, `cache_session_context`, `get_cached_session_context`, `cache_question_embedding`, `get_cached_embedding` — all replaced by cached `ToolContext`
- **`ChatSessionState` from TUI**: TUI no longer maintains its own copy of session state

## [0.29.1] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed

- **Document listing memory usage**: `list_documents` no longer loads full document content and docling blobs by default, preventing out-of-memory errors on large databases. Use `include_content=True` when content is needed.
- **Chat session_id not persisting across AG-UI requests**: `ChatSessionState.session_id` now defaults to `""` instead of auto-generating a UUID. This ensures the session_id assignment is detected as a state change and included in the `StateDeltaEvent` delta, allowing clients to persist it across requests.

## [0.29.0] - 2026-02-06

### Added

- **docling-serve Chunker OCR Options**: The docling-serve chunker now respects OCR settings from `conversion_options`
  - Passes `do_ocr`, `force_ocr`, `ocr_engine`, and `ocr_lang` to the chunking API
  - Allows disabling OCR via config when running docling-serve in read-only containers
- **RLM Agent (Recursive Language Model)**: New agent for complex analytical tasks via sandboxed Python code execution
  - Solves problems traditional RAG can't handle: aggregation, computation, multi-document analysis
  - Docker-based sandbox with full Python environment (no import restrictions)
  - Container reuse within a single `rlm()` call for reduced latency
  - Available functions: `search()`, `list_documents()`, `get_document()`, `get_docling_document()`, `llm()`
  - Pre-loaded documents support via `documents` variable
  - Context filter for scoping searches without LLM control
  - New `client.rlm(question)` method on HaikuRAG client
  - New `haiku-rag rlm` CLI command
  - New `rlm_question` MCP tool
  - New config options: `docker_image`, `docker_memory_limit`
- **CI**: Docker sandbox integration tests run in GitHub Actions

### Fixed

- **CI**: Cache HuggingFace tokenizer to prevent flaky test failures when HuggingFace has transient outages

## [0.28.0] - 2026-01-31

### Changed

- **Iterative Research Planning**: Research graph now uses an iterative feedback loop instead of batch question processing
  - Planner proposes ONE question at a time, sees the answer, then decides whether to continue
  - Removes `gather_context` tool — planner proposes questions directly
  - Simpler flow: `plan_next` → `search_one` → loop back until complete → `synthesize`
  - Consolidated `build_conversational_graph()` into `build_research_graph(output_mode="conversational")`

### Removed

- **Dead config options**: Removed vestigial fields from iterative planning refactor
  - `confidence_threshold` from `ResearchConfig` and `ResearchState` (LLM decides completion via `is_complete`)
  - `max_sub_questions` from `QAConfig` (iterative flow uses one question at a time)
  - `sub_questions` field from `ResearchContext` (no longer populated)

## [0.27.2] - 2026-01-29

### Added

- **Deep Ask Evaluations**: QA benchmarks can now use the research graph for multi-step reasoning
  - New `--deep` flag on `evaluations run` enables deep ask mode
  - Uses research graph with `max_iterations=2` and `confidence_threshold=0.0`
  - Evaluation name automatically suffixed with `_deep` when enabled
  - Experiment metadata includes `deep_ask` field for tracking
- **Chat Agent Document Awareness Tools**: Two new tools for browsing and understanding the knowledge base
  - `list_documents` — Returns `DocumentListResponse` with paginated documents (50 per page), page number, total pages, and total count; respects session document filter
  - `summarize_document` — Generate LLM-powered summaries of specific documents
- **Document Count API**: New `count_documents(filter)` method on `HaikuRAG` client for efficient document counting
- **Read-Only Initial Context**: Initial context is now locked after the first message, providing consistent session context
  - Chat TUI: `--initial-context` CLI option sets background context for the session
  - Context can be edited via command palette before the first message is sent
  - After first message, context becomes read-only (view only)
  - Clearing chat resets context to CLI value and unlocks editing
  - Web app: Memory panel now serves dual purpose - edit initial context before first message, view session context after
  - Agent uses `initial_context` as fallback when `session_context` is empty

### Changed

- **AG-UI State Delta Updates**: Web application now sends `StateDeltaEvent` (JSON Patch RFC 6902) instead of full `StateSnapshotEvent` for state updates
  - Reduces bandwidth when state grows large (e.g., 50 Q&As with citations)
  - First request still sends full snapshot; subsequent requests send only changes
  - Backend logging shows incoming/outgoing state events for debugging

### Fixed

- **Chat TUI Session State Sync**: TUI now syncs full session state from AG-UI events

## [0.27.1] - 2026-01-27

### Added

- **Initial Context for Chat Sessions**: New `initial_context` field on `ChatSessionState` allows external clients to seed sessions with background context
  - Static context set once at session creation, used as fallback when no cached session context exists
  - Incorporated into first summarization, after which evolved `session_context` takes precedence
  - Eliminates need for clients to import and call internal cache functions (`cache_session_context`, `get_cached_session_context`)
  - `session_id` now auto-generates a UUID if not provided (previously defaulted to empty string)

### Fixed

- **AG-UI StateSnapshotEvent JSON Serialization**: Chat agent tools now use `model_dump(mode="json")` when creating `StateSnapshotEvent`
  - Fixes `TypeError: Object of type datetime is not JSON serializable` when external clients persist AG-UI state to database JSON columns

## [0.27.0] - 2026-01-26

### Added

- **Evaluation Database Hosting**: Pre-built evaluation databases available on HuggingFace
  - `evaluations download <dataset>` downloads pre-built databases from `ggozad/haiku-rag-eval-dbs`
  - `evaluations upload <dataset>` uploads databases to HuggingFace (maintainer only)
  - Supports `all` argument to download/upload all datasets at once
  - Use `--force` flag to overwrite existing databases
  - Avoids lengthy database rebuild times for users running benchmarks
- **Stable Citation Registry**: Citation indices now persist across tool calls within a session
  - Same `chunk_id` always returns the same citation index (first-occurrence-wins)
  - New `citation_registry: dict[str, int]` field on `ChatSessionState`
  - New `get_or_assign_index(chunk_id)` method for stable index assignment
  - Registry serialized/restored via AG-UI state protocol
- **Prior Answer Recall**: The `ask` tool automatically checks conversation history before research
  - Finds semantically similar prior answers using embedding similarity (0.7 cosine threshold)
  - Relevant prior answers are passed to the research planner as context
  - Planner can return empty sub_questions when context is sufficient, avoiding redundant searches
- **Dynamic Session Context**: Compressed conversation history for multi-turn chat
  - New `SessionContext` model stores summarized conversation state instead of raw Q&A history
  - Background LLM-based summarization runs after each `ask` tool call (non-blocking)
  - Previous summarization tasks are cancelled when new ones start
  - Research graph receives compact context (~1,000-2,000 tokens) instead of raw qa_history (potentially thousands of tokens)
  - New `session_context` field on `ChatSessionState` synced via AG-UI state protocol
  - Chat TUI: New context modal (`Ctrl+O`) to view current session context
- **Session Document Filter**: Restrict all search/ask operations to selected documents
  - New `document_filter` field on `ChatSessionState` stores list of document titles/URIs
  - Session filter combines with per-tool `document_name` filter using AND logic
  - Multi-document selection uses OR logic within the session filter
  - Filter persists across tool calls and chat clears via AG-UI state protocol
  - Chat TUI: Access via command palette ("Filter documents" command)
  - Web Application: Filter button in header shows count of selected documents

## [0.26.8] - 2026-01-22

### Added

- **Jina Reranker v3**: Added support for Jina reranking with API mode (`provider: jina`) and local inference (`provider: jina-local`, requires `[jina]` extra)
- **Model Downloads**: `download-models` now pre-downloads HuggingFace models for `sentence-transformers`, `mxbai`, and `jina-local`
- **Reranker Factory**: Removed unreliable `id(config)`-based caching from `get_reranker()`; factory now always instantiates fresh

### Changed

- **Agent Search Result Display**: Search results now show rank position instead of raw scores
  - `SearchResult.format_for_agent()` accepts optional `rank` and `total` parameters
  - Output changes from `(score: 0.02)` to `[rank 1 of 5]` when rank is provided
  - Prevents LLMs from misinterpreting low RRF hybrid search scores as "2% relevant"
  - QA and Research agents updated to pass rank/total to formatted results
  - Agent prompts updated to reference rank-based ordering instead of scores

### Fixed

- **Test Cassette Organization**: Consolidated all VCR cassettes to `tests/cassettes/`
- **Environment Loading**: Fixed `.env` file loading to search from current working directory instead of source file directory ([#250](https://github.com/ggozad/haiku.rag/pull/250)) - thanks @tianyicui

## [0.26.7] - 2026-01-20

### Added

- **Frontend Linting**: Added Biome for linting and formatting the frontend codebase

## [0.26.4] - 2026-01-15

### Added

- **AGUI_STATE_KEY Constant**: Exported `AGUI_STATE_KEY` (`"haiku.rag.chat"`) from `haiku.rag.agents.chat` for namespaced AG-UI state emission
  - Enables integrators to use a consistent key when combining haiku.rag with other agents
  - Backend, TUI, and frontend now use this key for state emission and extraction

## [0.26.3] - 2026-01-15

### Added

- **Enhanced Database Info**: `haiku-rag info` now displays `pydantic-ai` version and `docling-document schema` version
- **Keyed State Emission for Chat Agent**: New `state_key` parameter in `ChatDeps` for namespaced AG-UI state snapshots
  - When set, tools emit `{state_key: snapshot}` instead of bare state, enabling state merging when multiple agents share state
  - Default `None` preserves backwards compatibility (bare state emission)
- **Page Image Generation Control**: New `generate_page_images` option in `ConversionOptions` to control PDF page image extraction

### Changed

- **CLI Error Handling**: Commands (`rebuild`, `vacuum`, `create-index`, `ask`, `research`) now propagate errors with proper exit codes instead of swallowing exceptions

### Fixed

- **Embed-only rebuild with changed vector dimensions**: Fixed `haiku-rag rebuild --embed-only` failing when the configured embedding model has different dimensions than the database
  - Store now reads stored vector dimension when opening existing databases, allowing chunks to be read regardless of current config
  - `_rebuild_embed_only` recreates the chunks table to handle dimension changes
  - `generate_page_images: bool = True` - Enable/disable rendered page images (used by `visualize_chunk()`)
  - Works with both `docling-local` and `docling-serve` converters
  - For `docling-serve`, maps to `image_export_mode` API parameter (`embedded`/`placeholder`)

- **AG-UI Research Example**: Removed `examples/ag-ui-research/` (replaced by `app/`)

## [0.25.0] - 2026-01-12

### Fixed

- **Large Document Storage Overflow**: Fixed "byte array offset overflow" panic when vacuuming/rebuilding databases with many large PDF documents ([#225](https://github.com/ggozad/haiku.rag/issues/225))
  - Root cause: Arrow's 32-bit string column offsets limited to ~2GB per fragment

- **Legacy Migrations**: Removed obsolete database migration files (`v0_9_3.py`, `v0_10_1.py`, `v0_19_6.py`). These migrations were for versions prior to 0.20.0 and are no longer needed since the current release requires a database rebuild anyway.

## [0.24.2] - 2026-01-08

### Fixed

- **Base64 Images in Expanded Context**: Fixed base64 image data leaking into expanded search results when `expand_context()` processed `PictureItem` objects. The issue was `PictureItem.export_to_markdown()` defaulting to `EMBEDDED` mode. Now explicitly uses `PLACEHOLDER` mode to prevent base64 data while still including VLM descriptions and captions.

## [0.24.1] - 2026-01-08

### Fixed

- **OpenAI Non-Reasoning Models**: Fixed `reasoning_effort` parameter being sent to non-reasoning OpenAI models (gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini), causing 400 errors. Now correctly detects reasoning models (o1, o3 series) using pydantic-ai's model profile.

- **Configuration**: Added `base_url` to `ModelConfig` and `EmbeddingModelConfig`
  - Enables custom endpoints for OpenAI-compatible providers (vLLM, LM Studio, etc.)
  - Model-level `base_url` takes precedence over provider config

### Deprecated

- **vLLM and LM Studio providers**: Use `openai` provider with `base_url` instead
  - `provider: vllm` → `provider: openai` with `base_url: http://localhost:8000/v1`
  - `provider: lm_studio` → `provider: openai` with `base_url: http://localhost:1234/v1`

### Added

- **DoclingDocument Storage**: Full DoclingDocument JSON is now stored with each document, enabling rich context and visual grounding
  - Documents store the complete DoclingDocument structure (JSON) and schema version
  - Chunks store metadata with JSON pointer references (`doc_item_refs`), semantic labels, section headings, and page numbers
  - New `ChunkMetadata` model for structured chunk provenance: `doc_item_refs`, `headings`, `labels`, `page_numbers`
  - `Document.get_docling_document()` method to parse stored DoclingDocument
  - `ChunkMetadata.resolve_doc_items()` to resolve JSON pointer refs to actual DocItem objects
  - `ChunkMetadata.resolve_bounding_boxes()` for visual grounding with page coordinates

- **Enhanced Search Results**: `search()` and `expand_context()` now return full provenance information
  - `SearchResult` includes `page_numbers`, `headings`, `labels`, and `doc_item_refs`
  - QA and research agents use provenance for better citations (page numbers, section headings)
- **Type-Aware Context Expansion**: `expand_context()` now uses document structure for intelligent expansion
  - Structural content (tables, code blocks, lists) expands to complete structures regardless of chunking
  - Text content uses radius-based expansion via `text_context_radius` setting
  - `max_context_items` and `max_context_chars` settings control expansion limits

  - CLI command: `haiku-rag visualize <chunk_id>`
  - Requires `textual-image` dependency and terminal with image support
- **Processing Primitives**: New methods for custom document processing pipelines
  - `convert()` - Convert files, URLs, or text to DoclingDocument
  - `chunk()` - Chunk a DoclingDocument into Chunk objects
  - `contextualize()` - Prepend section headings to chunk content for embedding
  - `embed_chunks()` - Generate embeddings for chunks
- **New `import_document()` Method**: Import pre-processed documents with custom chunks
  - Accepts `DoclingDocument` directly for rich metadata (visual grounding, page numbers)
  - Use when document conversion, chunking, or embedding were done externally
  - Chunks without embeddings are automatically embedded
- **Automatic Chunk Embedding**: `import_document()` and `update_document()` automatically embed chunks that don't have embeddings
  - Pass chunks with or without embeddings - missing embeddings are generated
  - Chunks with pre-computed embeddings are stored as-is
- **Format Parameter for Text Conversion**: New `format` parameter for `convert()` and `create_document()` to specify content type
  - Supports `"md"` (default) for markdown and `"html"` for HTML content

- **Embedding Architecture**: Moved embedding generation from `ChunkRepository` to client layer
  - Repository is now a pure persistence layer
  - Client handles embedding via `_ensure_chunks_embedded()`
- **Chunk Text Storage**: Chunks store raw text; headings prepended only at embedding time
  - Stored chunk content stays clean without duplicate heading prefixes
  - Local and serve chunkers now produce identical output
- **Citation Models**: Introduced `RawSearchAnswer` for LLM output, `SearchAnswer` with resolved citations
- **Page Image Generation**: Always enabled for local docling converter (required for visual grounding)
- **Download Models Progress**: `haiku-rag download-models` now shows real-time progress with Rich progress bars for Ollama model downloads

### Removed

- **BREAKING: `markdown_preprocessor` Config Option**: Use processing primitives (`convert()`, `chunk()`, `embed_chunks()`) for custom pipelines
- **`update_document_fields()`**: Merged into `update_document()`

### Migration

This release requires a database rebuild to populate the new DoclingDocument fields:

```bash
haiku-rag rebuild
```

Existing documents without DoclingDocument data will work but won't have provenance information.

## [0.19.6] - 2025-12-03

### Changed

- **BREAKING: Explicit Database Creation**: Databases must now be explicitly created before use

### Changed

- **BREAKING: Default Embedding Model**: Changed default embedding model from `qwen3-embedding` to `qwen3-embedding:4b` with vector dimension 2560 (previously 4096)
  - New installations will use the smaller, more efficient 4B parameter model by default
  - **Action required**: Existing databases created with the old default will be incompatible. Users must either:
    - Explicitly set `embeddings.model: "qwen3-embedding"` and `embeddings.vector_dim: 4096` in their config to maintain compatibility with existing databases

### Changed

- **Vacuum Retention**: Default `vacuum_retention_seconds` increased from 60 seconds to 86400 seconds (1 day) for better version retention in typical workflows
- **BREAKING**: Major refactoring of graph-related code into unified `haiku.rag.graph` module structure:
  - `haiku.rag.research` → `haiku.rag.graph.research`
  - `haiku.rag.qa.deep` → `haiku.rag.graph.deep_qa`
  - `haiku.rag.agui` → `haiku.rag.graph.agui`

- **FileReader**: Error messages now include both original exception details and file path for easier debugging
- **Database Auto-creation**: Read operations (search, list, get, ask, research) no longer auto-create empty databases. Write operations (add, add-src, delete, rebuild) still create the database as needed. This prevents the confusing scenario where a search query creates an empty database. Fixes issue #137.

### Removed

- **BREAKING**: Removed `disable_autocreate` config option - the behavior is now automatic based on operation type
- **BREAKING**: Removed legacy `ResearchStream` and `ResearchStreamEvent` classes (replaced by AG-UI event protocol)

## [0.15.0] - 2025-11-07

### Added

- **File Monitor**: Orphan deletion feature - automatically removes documents from database when source files are deleted (enabled via `monitor.delete_orphans` config option, default: false)

### Fixed

- **File Monitor**: Fixed incorrect "Updated document" logging for unchanged files - monitor now properly skips files when MD5 hash hasn't changed

### Removed

- **BREAKING**: A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol support has been moved to a separate self-contained package in `examples/a2a-server/`. The A2A server is no longer part of the main haiku.rag package. Users who need A2A functionality can install and run it from the examples directory with `cd examples/a2a-server && uv sync`.
- **BREAKING**: Removed deprecated `.env`-based configuration system. The `haiku-rag init-config --from-env` command and `load_config_from_env()` function have been removed. All configuration must now be done via YAML files. Environment variables for API keys (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) and service URLs (e.g., `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`) are still supported and can be set via `.env` files.

  - `haiku.rag` - Full package with all extras (recommended for most users)
  - `haiku.rag-evals` - Internal benchmarking and evaluation tools
- Migrated from `pydantic-ai` to `pydantic-ai-slim` with extras system
- Docling is now an optional dependency (install with `haiku.rag-slim[docling]`)
- Package metadata checks now use `haiku.rag-slim` (always present) instead of `haiku.rag`
